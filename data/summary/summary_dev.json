        "input": "Finland refutes nuclear weapons ‘siting’ and reinforces border\nBy Gerard O'Dwyer\nNov 19, 03:42 AM\nHELSINKI — Finland has refuted any possibility that the currently unalignedNordicstate will consider hosting nuclear weapons on its territory once a member nation of NATO.\nThe rebuttal comes as Prime Minister Sanna Marin’s government presented new proposals to reinforce the country’s 830 mile (1,340 km) border with Russia.\nUnderlining the need to retain “good neighbor relations” with Russia, Sauli Niinist?, Finland’s president and commander-in-chief of the Finnish Armed Forces (FAF), said that siting nuclear weapons on its territory was never intimated or discussed as a pre-condition for Finnish membership in the alliance.\n“Finland has no intention of allowing nuclear weapons to be located on its territory. There are no indicators that any NATO-nation is offering nuclear arms to Finland,” Niinist? said.\nSome 28 member states have so far issued individual declarations that they believe Finland andSweden qualifyfor membership of the alliance and have a right to NATO support under Article 5.\nThe prospect of nuclear weapons being located in Finland post NATO membership is “nonsensical”, said Mika Aaltola, Director of the Helsinki-based Finnish Institute of International Affairs (Ulkopoliittinen Instituutti).\n“No nuclear weapons will be brought to Finland. Neither NATO nor Finland have such aspirations. The doctrines of the United States and other member countries do not include any offer of nuclear weapons to Finland. Moreover Finland has no desire to place nuclear weapons on its soil,” said Aaltola.\nLike Finland, Sweden has equally made it clear it is not prepared to enter in to preconditions on nuclear weapons ahead of NATO membership.\n“We won’t be making any preconditions. Sweden has the exact same approach as Finland as regards the issue of siting nuclear weapons in our countries. Naturally we embrace all of NATO’s capabilities on nuclear weapons, but on positioning Sweden and Finland share the same conclusions and are on the same page,” said Ulf Kristersson, Sweden’s Prime Minister.\nFinland, in advance of its pending membership of NATO, has mapped out plans to spend around $2 billion by 2025 to reinforce security along its extensive border with Russia. The defense budget will be expanded to include new border-security strengthening projects, the acquisition of new surveillance aircraft, the expansion of the Border Guard and the wider use of drones, security surveillance robots and electronic sensor technologies.\nIn the first stage, $150 million in funding has been earmarked to build sensor-supported fencing along parts of Finland’s Eastern border with Russia in 2023. The spending, which forms part of a range of new measures by Finland to fend off hybrid threats emanating from Russia, has been incorporated in to the Border Guard’s budget for 2023.\nThe Border Guard is currently building a two-mile “test fence,” costing $6.2 million, along a section of its eastern border with Russia. Ultimately, the border security enhancement plan is expected to result in the construction of up to 200 miles of new sensor-supported fencing along Finland’s border with Russia.\nThe Border Guard’s elevated budget for 2023 includes plans to upgrade its Air-Patrol Squadron (APS). One area of investment is to replace the Border Guard’s two Dornier 228 German-manufactured turboprop surveillance aircraft, introduced in 1995, with two new manned multipurpose aircraft.\nThe government has allocated the Border Guard a $170 million budget to procure two new surveillance aircraft. A procurement contract is expected to be concluded in 2023, and deployment of the aircraft is envisioned for 2026. The switch to jet propulsion will enable the Border Guard’s APS to operate the aircraft for longer periods and patrol larger areas.\nThe new multirole aircraft will be equipped with advanced radar and camera systems, radio interceptors and jammers rendering the planes capable of engaging in signals intelligence, said Maj. Kenneth Rosenqvist, the surveillance aircraft project’s procurement director.\n“The security environment has changed rapidly due to the current war situation in Ukraine. We have a much higher need to improve our capabilities,” said Rosenqvist.\nThe Finnish government has allocated $1.7 billion to the military for defense materiel procurements in 2023. This represents a $800 million increase compared to the defense equipment procurement budget for 2022.\n",

        "input": "WASHINGTON — Lockheed Martin will have a ship-based hypersonic missile launcher ready for flight tests next year, the company said, as part of the development work covered by a contract awarded Feb. 18.\nThrough a collaboration between the Army and the Navy, the hypersonic missile itself is already in flight tests, which will continue this year ahead of the Army forming its first hypersonic missile battery later in 2023. The Army has a basic truck-towed launcher and a standard weapon control system, developed through a previous weapon systems integration contract.\nNow, according to Steve Layne, vice president of Hypersonic Strike Weapon Systems at Lockheed Martin, last week’s $1.2 billion contract award will use the progress so far to create a sea-based hypersonic capability.\nLockheed Martin will develop a new launcher for the Zumwalt-class destroyer, the weapon control system will be adjusted for the maritime environment, and a subsequent round of flight tests will evaluate the changes that turn the basic hypersonic weapon system into the Navy’s Conventional Prompt Strike capability.\nLayne said Lockheed Martin, the Navy and the rest of the industry team are more than a year into developing the ship-based launcher.\n“We’re mid-way through that development phase right now,” he said in a Feb. 21 interview. “We’ve done a lot of sub-scale and full-scale testing and proofing on that capability, and more to follow as we move through 2023.”\nThat development work this year will lead to “a flight test campaign next year.”\nIn November, Vice Adm. Johnny Wolfe, the head of the Navy’s Strategic Systems Programs office, said the ship-based launcher would require pressurized air to shoot the weapon out of the launcher to a great enough height to allow the missile to light off without torching the ship deck below it. He said early Navy testing had already shown this was possible.\nEven as Lockheed Martin is working on the launcher, the weapon control system and more, Ingalls Shipbuilding is on contract to modify destroyer Zumwalt, so the futuristic-looking ship will be prepared to receive these new capabilities during a 2025 refit.\nIngalls Shipbuilding President Kari Wilkinson told reporters last month the Navy still hadn’t finalized the statement of work for the ship refit, as the sea service weighs how extensive a job it may be to install this new weapon onto Zumwalt and sister ships Michael Monsoor and Lyndon B. Johnson.\nLayne said the previous hypersonic missile contract covered development and testing of the basic weapon system, as well as missile deliveries to the Army’s first batteries, while this month’s contract includes the development work, as well as the delivery of missiles for use on Zumwalt destroyers and missiles for Army batteries that will be established later in the fielding process.\nThe Navy will need to award a third contract later this decade to cover the development of a submarine-launched hypersonic missile capability, Layne said. In this case again, the missile will be common, but the Virginia-class submarine will need its own launcher and its own modifications to the weapon control system. The third contract would cover that development, missile deliveries to submarines, plus any further missiles required by the Army or the Navy’s three Zumwalt destroyers, he added.\n",

        "input": "Boeing recently conducted a virtual demo from its Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) Lab that successfully combined data from different sources for multiple platforms across domains to create a common operating picture.\nBoeing software engineers demonstrated how the JADC2 Lab's ‘data fabric’ could combine real-time sensor data from Liquid Robotics’ Wave Gliders located in Hawaii and California with Automatic Identification System (AIS) ship data from the DoD’s Unified Data Library. The JADC2 Lab data fabric is a set of capabilities, host data services and products to contribute to a common operating picture for all users.\nDuring the demonstration, the position data from the Wave Gliders, which are long-duration Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs), as well as sensed AIS tracks were shared with a simulated E-7 Wedgetail operator, while E-7 data was shared with the JADC2 Lab to form a common operating picture.\nBy operating over the horizon and enabling real-time communications to sensors and systems below and above the sea, the Wave Glider Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) delivers vital intelligence on maritime threats for greater situational awareness and better decision-making. (Liquid Robotics)\n“The ability to share any data across systems, domains and providers will be critical in the interconnected battle space,” said Gerrin Inman, a Boeing software engineer and the JADC2 Lab demo team lead. “Resources are constrained at the tactical edge due to Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) considerations, but the JADC2 data fabric ensures that warfighters at the tactical edge have the latest capabilities and insights informed by the AI algorithms and data sets of the entire network.”\nThe E-7 Airborne Early Warning & Control (AEW&C) aircraft provides multi-domain surveillance, communications, and networked battle management capabilities and interoperability that multiplies the effectiveness of joint forces. (Boeing)\nThe demonstration also achieved another important objective: to show how Boeing’s Nostromo DevSecOps pipeline could detect a bug in the operational software and deploy an automated update to the E-7’s Mission Systems. In the hypothetical scenario, a bug in the data code resulted in the E-7 operator seeing inaccurate ship location information. The E-7 operator reported the issue to an operations center, represented by the JADC2 Lab, which then leveraged Boeing’s DevSecOps pipeline to fix the bug and deploy an automated update. The entire process caused minimal disruption to operators and downstream users.\nWhile the OMS-heavy E-7 was the primary platform in the simulated scenario, the possibilities for sharing data and common operating pictures between multi-domain systems is endless – from sensor to sensor, to platform, to shooter. Boeing’s focus on open architecture and DevSecOps provides warfighters with modern tools and capabilities for software development at the speed of relevance.\n“What we’ve demonstrated is the future of warfighting, which will only continue to evolve away from a platform or system-based approach and towards the internet of military things,” said Scott Dickson, Boeing’s director of Multi-Domain Integration. “If you can push updates to a system confidently and in real time without having to take it out of service, the result is greater mission readiness.”\nOver the last two years Boeing has successfully conducted flight tests marrying the OMS-compliant battle management command and control (BMC2) system to Northrop Grumman’s advanced, wide-band active electronically scanned array (AESA). These successful airborne tests of our OMS architecture are key steps in validating our approach and moving the product to fielding.\nLocated at the Boeing Developmental Center in Tukwila, Wash., the JADC2 Lab provides a location to integrate, rapidly prototype, and mature joint solutions while adhering to open architecture consistent with the DoD’s approved tech stack. Boeing stood up its JADC2 Lab in 2020 as the Air Force started up its Battle Lab.\n",

        "input": "You don't normally want to mix electricity and water, but electricity behaving like water has the potential to improve electronic devices. Recent work from the groups of engineer James Hone at Columbia and theoretical physicist Shaffique Adam at the National University of Singapore and Yale-NUS builds new understanding of this unusual hydrodynamic behavior that changes some old assumptions about the physics of metals. The study was published on April 15 in the journal Science Advances. \nIn the work, the team studied the behavior of a novel semiconductor in which negatively charged electrons and positively charged \"holes\" simultaneously carry current. They found that this current can be described with just two \"hydrodynamic\" equations: one describing how the electrons and holes slide against each other, and a second for how all of the charges move together through the atomic lattice of the material.\n\"Simple formulas usually mean simple physics,\" Hone said, who was astonished when Adam's postdoc, Derek Ho, built the new model, which challenges assumptions many physicists learn about metals early in their education. \"We were all taught that in a normal metal, all you really need to know is how an electron bounces off various types of imperfections,\" Hone said. \"In this system, the basic models we learned about in our first courses just don't apply.\"\nIn metal wires carrying an electrical current, there are many moving electrons that largely ignore each other, like riders on a crowded subway. As the electrons move, they inevitably run into either physical defects in the material carrying them or vibrations that cause them to scatter. Current slows down, and energy is lost. But, in materials that have smaller numbers of electrons, those electrons actually interact strongly with each other and will flow together, like water through a pipe. They still encounter those same imperfections, but their behavior is completely different: instead of thinking about individual electrons randomly scattering, you now have to treat the entire set of electrons (and holes) together, Hone said.\nTo experimentally test their simple new model of hydrodynamic conductivity, the team studied bilayer graphene—a material made from two atom-thin sheets of carbon. Hone's Ph.D. student Cheng Tan measured electrical conductivity from room temperature down to near absolute zero as he varied the density of electrons and holes. Tan and Ho found an excellent match between the model and their results. \"It's striking that experimental data agrees so much better with hydrodynamic theory than old \"standard theory\" about conductivity,\" Ho said.\nThe model worked when the material was tuned in a way that allows conductivity to be turned on and off, and the hydrodynamic behavior was prominent even at room temperature. \"It is really remarkable that bilayer graphene has been studied for over 15 years, but until now we did not correctly understand its room-temperature conductivity,\" said Hone, who is also Wang Fong-Jen Professor and chair of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Columbia Engineering.\nLow-resistance, room-temperature conductivity could have very practical applications. Existing superconducting materials, which conduct electricity without resistance, need to be kept incredibly cold. Materials capable of hydrodynamic flow could help researchers build more efficient electronic devices—known as viscous electronics—that don't require such intense and expensive cooling.\nOn a more fundamental level, the team verified that the sliding motion between electrons and holes isn't specific to graphene, said Adam, associate professor from the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at the National University of Singapore and the Division of Science at Yale-NUS College. Because this relative motion is universal, researchers should be able to find it in other materials—especially as improving fabrication techniques continues to yield cleaner and cleaner samples, which the Hone Lab has focused on developing over the past decade. In the future, researchers might also design specific geometries to further improve performance of devices built to take advantage of this unique water-like collective behavior.\n",

The plan, which went into initial operating capability this October, would see units spend eight months each in a modernization-training-mission cycle, while preparing to deploy to a specific part of the world.\nPrecision Strike Missile gets green light for development: The Army has approved the Precision Strike Missile program to move into the engineering and manufacturing development phase, just ahead of a major test at Vandenberg Space Force Base, California, where the weapon will be shot to observe its range.\nProject Convergence may go overseas: The first Project Convergence took place in late summer and early fall 2020 at Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona. This year, operational and experimental Army units, including the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and the first multidomain task force at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state, will attend. Gen. Charles Flynn, the head of U.S. Army Pacific Command, told Defense News in a Sept. 30 interview he would like to eventually see part of Project Convergence take place in the region.\nThe Army is preparing to release its climate strategy: The Army plans to release its upcoming climate strategy this fall, which is expected to push the service to adapt so it can both operate in and protect itself against increasingly harsh environments, while also becoming more energy-efficient.\nA California Guard unit is taking the lead on urban ops: Between Oct. 17-23, at least 50 soldiers, allied officers and first responders will meet in person for the first-ever urban planner conference, aimed at brigade and above-level urban operations. Another 50 to 100 will meet online. The conference is being held at Joint Forces Training Base Los Alamitos, California.\nHere are the four key problem areas for soldiers in the Pacific: Gen. Charles Flynn, the head of U.S. Army Pacific Command, says there are three regions that pull his attention: the southeast, western and northern areas surrounding Singapore. Flynn has other considerations, too. He is concerned about whether Army forces working with partners in the region are doing the work those countries and their leaders want, “not what we want to be working on.”\nGuard leaders push back on some state missions — but will still do them: Senior leaders from across the National Guard sounded off on the impact of continuing state missions during an Oct. 12 panel at AUSA.\nThe Army wants reusable, networked landmines: Army combat engineers are looking for new ways to deploy “terrain shaping obstacles” or landmines by artillery, drone or robot ground vehicles for the close, middle and long-range fight. Better aviation platforms, networks and ground vehicles are offering a new breadth and depth to war, but terrain-shaping denies the enemy the ability to effectively use their own systems and puts the control of the battlefield tempo into soldiers’ hands.\nSFAB soldiers are heading out in smaller teams to more places: Soldiers who want to deploy a lot in the coming years may want to join one of the Army’s security force assistance brigades. SFAB officials said at AUSA that they’re dispatching teams of four to 12 soldiers, headed by a captain, to work in one location for months or even a year at a time. This past fiscal year, SFAB soldiers were deployed to 41 countries.\nArmy Software Factory to churn out soldier coders: As the military struggles to recruit more skilled cyber employees, the Army has been experimenting with growing battlefield coders from the untapped talent within its ranks.

        "input": "An advance in the use of antiferromagnetic materials in memory storage devices has been made by an international team of physicists.\nAntiferromagnets are materials that have an internal magnetism caused by the spin of electrons, but almost no external magnetic field. They are of interest because of their potential for data storage since absence of this external (or \"long range\") magnetic field means the data units—bits—can be packed in more densely within the material.\nThis is in contrast to ferromagnets, used in standard magnetic memory devices. The bits in these devices do generate long-range magnetic fields, which prevent them being packed too closely, because otherwise they would interact.\nThe property that is measured to read out an antiferromagnetic bit is called the Hall effect, which is a voltage that appears perpendicular to the applied current direction. If the spins in the antiferromagnet are all flipped, the Hall voltage changes sign. So one sign of the Hall voltage corresponds to a \"1,\" and the other sign to a \"0\"—the basis of binary code used in all computing systems.\nAlthough scientists have known about the Hall effect in ferromagnetic materials for a long time, the effect in antiferromagnets has only been recognized in the past decade or so and is still poorly understood.\nA team of researchers at the University of Tokyo, in Japan, Cornell and Johns Hopkins Universities in the U.S. and the University of Birmingham in the UK have suggested an explanation for the \"Hall effect\" in a Weyl antiferromagnet (Mn3Sn), a material which has a particularly strong spontaneous Hall effect.\nTheir results, published in Nature Physics, have implications for both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets—and therefore for next generation memory storage devices overall.\nThe researchers were interested in Mn3Sn because it is not a perfect antiferromagnet, but does have a weak external magnetic field. The team wanted to find out if this weak magnetic field was responsible for the Hall effect.\nIn their experiment, the team used a device invented by Doctor Clifford Hicks, at the University of Birmingham, who is also a co-author on the paper. The device can be used to apply a tunable stress to the material being tested. By applying this stress to this Weyl antiferromagnet, the researchers observed that the residual external magnetic field increased.\nIf the magnetic field were driving the Hall effect, there would be a corresponding effect on the voltage across the material. The researchers showed that, in fact, the voltage does not change substantially, proving that the magnetic field is not important. Instead, they concluded, the arrangement of spinning electrons within the material is responsible for the Hall effect.\nClifford Hicks, co-author on the paper at the University of Birmingham, says that \"these experiments prove that the Hall effect is caused by the quantum interactions between conduction electrons and their spins. The findings are important for understanding—and improving—magnetic memory technology.\"\n",

        "input": "Creating molecular microrobots that mimic the abilities of living organisms is a dream of nanotechnology, as illustrated by the renowned physicist Richard Feynman. There are a number of challenges in achieving this goal. One of the most significant of these is the creation of directed self-propulsion in water.\nA team of three scientists from Hokkaido University, led by Assistant Professor Yoshiyuki Kageyama, has succeeded in creating a microcrystal that utilizes self-continuous reciprocating motion for propulsion. Their findings were published in the journal Small.\nThe dream of microrobots is an old one, having been addressed in science fiction for many decades, and popularized by the rise of nanotechnology. One aspect of these robots is self-propulsion, the ability to move themselves self-sustainably. There are two major challenges to achieving this: the first is to make a molecular robot that can reciprocally deform, and the second is converting this deformation into propulsion of the molecular robot.\nKageyama's group built on their previous research that had solved the first challenge—the creation of molecular robots that can reciprocally deform. However, tiny objects cannot convert their reciprocal motion into progressive motion, in general, as explained by Edward Purcell's scallop theorem. In the current study, the scientists went to the next step and succeeded in realizing self-propulsion of the molecular robot in an experimental system where motion was confined to two dimensions; in this system, viscous resistance acts anisotropically, making it negligibly weak.\nMobile molecular robots swim in water\nThe microrobot was powered by blue light, which drove a series of reactions leading to the fin flipping and the propulsion. Due to the nature of the reactions, the motion was not continuous, but occurred intermittently; in addition, the molecular robots exhibited one of three different styles of propulsion: a \"stroke\" style, with the fin in front; a \"kick\" style, with the fin behind; or a \"side-stroke\" style, with the fin to one side. The nature of mobility was affected by the area of the fin and its angle of elevation; individual crystals propelled themselves in different directions and styles.\nThe scientists then created a computational minimum model to understand the variables that affected the propulsion in a two-dimensional tank. They were able to determine that fin length, fin ratio and elevation angle were the key variables affecting the direction and the pace of propulsions.\n\"The result, which demonstrated that tiny flappers can swim assisted by the anisotropy caused by confined spaces, could spur research into molecular robots,\" says Kageyama. \"A similar mechanism may be in the movement of small aquatic organisms in specific conditions such as inside eggs.\"\n",

        "input": "Nov. 8, 2022 | ByAmanda Miller\nInternational militaries will join the Space Force in December for its flagship training series Space Flag, just one new aspect of Space Training and Readiness Command’s planned slate of space-oriented exercises.\nActivated in August 2021, STARCOM is one of three USSF field commands, roughly equivalent to an Air Force major command in the newer service’s flatter organizational structure. STARCOM added new types of personnel to Space Flag in 2022, when the exercise also received accreditation as a Joint National Training Capability.\nThe JNTC accreditationgave the command “more incentive to bring in other service partners,” said Maj. Gen. Shawn N. Bratton, commander of STARCOM. A Space Flag event in August, for example, involved members of the Army’s 1st Space Brigade practicing electronic warfare alongside Space Force Guardians. The event also included more cyber and intelligence personnel, Bratton told reporters atAFA’s Air, Space & Cyber Conferencein September.\n“We actually brought the cyber team in like a week or two ahead of time [for] the cyber portion of the exercise,” Bratton said. “Then the outcomes of that impacted the space operations piece.”\nDoing so amounted to “a good first step” in incorporating cyber, Bratton said, “but we really need to integrate them together. … I think in December, we’ll be a little more integrated, and then I expect in next year’s Space Flag series, that cyber team will be fully integrated.”\nIn addition to Space Flag, STARCOM has begun to stage its new Skies series of exercises for Guardians and space personnel in the Air National Guard.\nBlack Skies, a live-fire electronic warfare exercise against a satellite target for USSF’s Space Operations Command, took place in September. Guardians practiced attacking what Bratton characterized as “the beginnings” of a training range in orbit—the range coming to be known as the National Space Test and Training Complex, or NSTTC.\nThe Guardians practiced EW against a legacy satellite target, the existence of which was why, Bratton said, Black Skies came first in the series.\nA new Red Skies exercise will focus on orbital warfare, he said, which will call for a new “orbital warfare capability,” though “live-flying an asset on orbit” is unlikely to happen as soon as 2023—“as much as my team is super excited about doing that.”\nA Blue Skies series will eventually focus on cyber.\nBratton said the fiscal 2023 and 2024 budgets will determine how much more STARCOM might be able to add to the NSTTC, while it’s already developing the range’s “digital side.” Meanwhile, the balance of live vs. virtual training remained a question.\n“How do I weigh the value of live training versus simulation, and how do I know which provides a better training environment?” Bratton said. Right now, space operators in the Space Force never operate a real satellite until they arrive at their first unit, arriving prepared with only classroom instruction.\n“We don’t think that’s exactly right,” he said, “and so we’re trying to balance that with the resources we have.” He said partnering with a university program, such as with the Air Force Academy’s FalconSAT program to build and fly cubesats, could provide a cost-effective solution.\n",

        "input": "The Missile Defense Agency has launched a project that aims to set the technical groundwork for a potential live-fire demonstration of a domestic cruise missile defense architecture by working first to execute simulated events connecting Army and Navy battle management tools with the guided-missile launcher system used to defend Washington, DC, 24/7.\nThe project is called Cruise Missile Defense of the Homeland NCR-IADS and MDA is pulling in three defense contractors to support the effort, modifying existing contracts last November with Northrop Grumman and Numerica, and is currently finalizing terms with Raytheon to participate, according to an agency official. This project has not previously been reported.\n“The deliverables will consist of software modifications necessary to conduct a simulated engagement within the National Capital Region (NCR) Integrated Air Defense System (IADS) architecture,” MDA spokeswoman Heather Cavaliere toldInside Defensein a May 11 statement.\nThe MDA effort aims to support North American Aerospace and Defense Command’s desire for a cruise missile defense capability. Last year, MDA and NORAD jointly lobbied for a $27 million addition to the Pentagon’s fiscal year 2022 budget request to buy an elevated sensor that would be used for homeland cruise missile defense. Congress did not fund the project.\nAs an alternative, MDA used $13.9 million in FY-22 funding to launch work on the simulation exercise, an effort the agency plans to allocate $30.9 million toward between FY-23 and FY-27. In addition, MDA has identified this project as the agency’s No. 1 unfunded priority and is seeking an additional $27 million to the FY-23 budget request of $10.8 million. Separately, Gen. Glen VanHerck, NORAD and U.S. Northern Command chief, is seeking$50.7 million as an unfunded FY-23 requirementfor the same cruise missile defense project.\nMDA and NORAD hope Congress will add the $27 million to “demonstrate tower-based fire-control radar to provide high fidelity tracks and electronic identification for CMD-H,” states MDA's proposal for additional FY-23 funding. The money will buy and demonstrate an X-band radar, integrate it into the equivalent fire-control architecture that MDA is developing right now with Northrop, Numerica and Raytheon as part of the simulated exercises.\nIf Congress OKs this $27 million unfunded priority, the goal is to conduct as many as three one-week live exercises at White Sands Missile Range, NM -- one in FY-23 and two in FY-24. The project aims to address NORAD’s goal to improve both domain awareness and information superiority and demonstrate the efficacy of a “limited area defense” against cruise missiles.\n“If the FY-23 [unfunded priority] is funded, the X-band sensor that would be used will be a repurposed, existing X-band radar,” Cavaliere said. “The demonstration would be conducted at White Sands Missile Range utilizing the terrain of the range to elevate the sensor consistent with heights that are being considered to support the proposed cruise missile defense architectures. It will not be elevated in an aircraft.”\nMDA is working now to set a technical framework for the proposed live-fire events.\nOnce the contract modification with Raytheon is complete, the company will work to integrate the Army’s Integrated and Missile Defense Battle Command system directly with the ground-based launcher associated with the National/Norwegian Advance Surface to Air Missile System (NASAMS) -- the only deployed domestic cruise missile defense system. NASAMS is a centerpiece of the National Capital Region Integrated Air and Missile Defense architecture.\n“The deliverables will consist of software modifications necessary to conduct the (simulated engagement) demonstration and subject matter expertise to support the integration of these assets,” said Cavaliere.\nNorthrop, prime contractor for IBCS, and Numerica, which Cavaliere said supports Northrop in several areas including target tracking and identification, are working on parallel projects.\n“The Northrop effort supports the overall integration of the sensors and effectors associated with the NCR Integrated Air Defense System,” she said. “Additionally, the Northrop effort will assist in the integration of the Missile Defense Agency developed Joint Track Management Capability software that allows the bridging of Army and Navy systems to support composite tracking and that will be available to support the NCR IADS (simulated engagement) Demonstration.”\nThere are three simulated engagements planned, one each in the second, third and fourth quarters of FY-23. “All of the deliverables will be integrated and tested at increasing levels of complexity during the (simulated engagement) demonstration series,” she said.\nThese simulated demonstrations will be executed in Huntsville, AL, in coordination with Army Space and Missile Defense Command, Cavaliere said.\n“The (simulated engagement) demonstrations will utilize existing data lines/links to sensors and other assets in the NCR area,” she added.\n",

        "input": "University of Delaware (UD) engineers have demonstrated a way to effectively capture 99% of carbon dioxide from air using a novel electrochemical system powered by hydrogen.\nIt is a significant advance for carbon dioxide capture and could bring more environmentally friendly fuel cells closer to market.\nThe research team, led by UD Professor Yushan Yan, reported their method in Nature Energy on Thursday, February 3.\nGame-changing tech for fuel cell efficiency\nFuel cells work by converting fuel chemical energy directly into electricity. They can be used in transportation for things like hybrid or zero-emission vehicles.\nYan, Henry Belin du Pont Chair of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at UD, has been working for some time to improve hydroxide exchange membrane (HEM) fuel cells, an economical and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional acid-based fuel cells used today.\nBut HEM fuel cells have a shortcoming that has kept them off the road—they are extremely sensitive to carbon dioxide in the air. Essentially, the carbon dioxide makes it hard for a HEM fuel cell to breathe.\nThis defect quickly reduces the fuel cell's performance and efficiency by up to 20%, rendering the fuel cell no better than a gasoline engine. Yan's research group has been searching for a workaround for this carbon dioxide conundrum for over 15 years.\nA few years back, the researchers realized this disadvantage might actually be a solution—for carbon dioxide removal.\n\"Once we dug into the mechanism, we realized the fuel cells were capturing just about every bit of carbon dioxide that came into them, and they were really good at separating it to the other side,\" said Brian Setzler, assistant professor for research in chemical and biomolecular engineering and paper co-author.\nWhile this isn't good for the fuel cell, the team knew if they could leverage this built-in \"self-purging\" process in a separate device upstream from the fuel cell stack, they could turn it into a carbon dioxide separator.\n\"It turns out our approach is very effective. We can capture 99% of the carbon dioxide out of the air in one pass if we have the right design and right configuration,\" said Yan.\nSo, how did they do it?\nThey found a way to embed the power source for the electrochemical technology inside the separation membrane. The approach involved internally short-circuiting the device.\n\"It's risky, but we managed to control this short-circuited fuel cell by hydrogen. And by using this internal electrically shorted membrane, we were able to get rid of the bulky components, such as bipolar plates, current collectors or any electrical wires typically found in a fuel cell stack,\" said Lin Shi, a doctoral candidate in the Yan group and the paper's lead author.\nNow, the research team had an electrochemical device that looked like a normal filtration membrane made for separating out gases, but with the capability to continuously pick up minute amounts of carbon dioxide from the air like a more complicated electrochemical system.\nIn effect, embedding the device's wires inside the membrane created a short-cut that made it easier for the carbon dioxide particles to travel from one side to the other. It also enabled the team to construct a compact, spiral module with a large surface area in a small volume. In other words, they now have a smaller package capable of filtering greater quantities of air at a time, making it both effective and cost-effective for fuel cell applications. Meanwhile, fewer components mean less cost, and more importantly, provide a way to easily scale up for the market.\nThe research team's results showed that an electrochemical cell measuring 2 inches by 2 inches could continuously remove about 99% of the carbon dioxide found in air flowing at a rate of approximately two liters per minute. An early prototype spiral device about the size of a 12-ounce soda can is capable of filtering 10 liters of air per minute and scrubbing out 98% of the carbon dioxide, the researchers said.\nScaled for an automotive application, the device would be roughly the size of a gallon of milk, Setzler said, but the device could be used to remove carbon dioxide elsewhere, too. For example, the UD-patented technology could enable lighter, more efficient carbon dioxide removal devices in spacecraft or submarines, where ongoing filtration is critical.\n\"We have some ideas for a long-term roadmap that can really help us get there,\" said Setzler.\nAccording to Shi, since the electrochemical system is powered by hydrogen, as the hydrogen economy develops, this electrochemical device could also be used in airplanes and buildings where air recirculation is desired as an energy-saving measure. Later this month, following his dissertation defense, Shi will join Versogen, a UD spinoff company founded by Yan, to continue advancing research toward sustainable green hydrogen.\nCo-authors on the paper from the Yan lab include Yun Zhao, co-first author and research associate, who performed experimental work essential for testing the device; Stephanie Matz, a doctoral student who contributed to the designing and fabrication of the spiral module, and Shimshon Gottesfeld, an adjunct professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering at UD. Gottesfeld was principal investigator on the 2019 project, funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), that led to the findings.\n",

        "input": "Training with the first Long Range Hypersonic Weapon prototype system will commence on Oct. 18, says Rob Strider, deputy director of the Army Hypersonic Project Office.\nBy THERESA HITCHENS；on August 11, 2021 at 10:39 AM\nWASHINGTON: The US Army is steadily progressing with its Long Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW) prototype, to the point the service plans to start training operations staff on ground-based equipment by mid October, says Bob Strider, deputy direction of the Army Hypersonic Project Office.\n“We are moving very rapidly toward getting this capability put in place,” he told the annual Space and Missile Defense Symposium on Tuesday. “We’re very, very confident that we’re going to meet our 2023 fielding date.”\nTo be clear, the hypersonic weapon itself won’t be fielded until that 2023 target. But the service is moving forward with installing all the ground equipment needed to make the LRHW, newly dubbed the Dark Eagle, operate successfully. Strider said that equipment should be in place at the currently undisclosed deployment location in September.\nThe system includes the hypersonic missile itself, the mobile launchers (called Transporter Erector Launchers, or TELS) and a mobile command and control (C2), according to Strider’s slides.\n“It’s going to be a battery of four launchers, two missiles per for basic load of eight,” he explained. “It’s going to be a Battery Operations Center — that’s our C2 system that is based against an AFATDS, the [Advanced] Field Artillery Tactical Data System …. with a support vehicle,” he explained. “This will be a road mobile system, which is critical, the ability to move around the battlefield.”\nThe ground equipment will allow the unit to begin training, including loading and offloading practice canisters from C-130 transport aircraft, Strider explained. It also will lay the ground work for upcoming Joint Flight Tests (JFTs) done in coordination with the Navy, and with observers from the Missile Defense Agency.\nThe first operationally configured JFT will take place in early in fiscal 2022; the second, using a TEL, in fourth quarter 2022; and the third — which Strider called the “graduation event,” in which the unit will independently “fly in, they will set up, they will launch, and redeploy back to home base” — in early fiscal 2023.\nNotably, Strider did not say is which unit will be the lucky one to get the first Dark Eagle prototype. Given, however, the the LRHW is very much aimed at deterring peer competitors China and Russia, one might rationally guess that the unit likely will be based in the Indo-Pacific or European theater.\nAs Breaking Defense was first to report back in May, the LRHW provides a capability at a distance greater than 2,775 km, or about 1,725 miles. That means if the missiles were based on US soil in Guam, they could still strike Chinese troops besieging Taipei.\n“You know we’re number three in this race,” Strider stressed, “and we’ve got to catch up.”\nTo the end of speeding the program, he said, the Army’s Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office (RCCTO) has “embedded” a transition team from the Program Executive Office (PEO) Missiles and Space into Strider’s hypersonic project office. RCCTO is responsible for development of prototypes for both offensive hypersonic missiles and missile defense lasers. The PEO is responsible for weapons procurement, or programs of record.\nThe transition of Dark Eagle from a prototype development to a program of record is slated for fiscal 2023, Strider said. Further, the two teams already are working together to craft a budget submission for fiscal 2024 through 2028.\nThe Army and Navy are partners in the development of the missile’s core, the Common Hypersonic Glide Body. The difference is in how the two services launch, Strider explained.\n“The Army does everything hot launch; the Navy does what’s called a cold launch, where they eject it out and then they light the booster after it’s ejected from the canister,” he said.\n",

A variety of HPE could be of potential military and intelligence operational value. Some examples are increased strength, speed, endurance, and intelligence; others are reduced sleep needs and reaction times. This report provides an examination of three possible modalities for generating HPE: (1) genetic modifications, (2) artificial intelligence (AI), and (3) Internet of Bodies (IoB) approaches in which devices implanted in or worn by a human are connected to a network. For each modality, this report provides an overview of its potential for HPE, the state of the enabling technologies, and the associated challenges (both technical and ethical). The report also features a discussion of the countries where the capabilities or the associated foundational research are being most actively pursued.\nEach of these HPE realms relies at some point on digital signals. In addition to any HPE, per se, the emission, storage, and manipulation of this digital information might pose risks and opportunities for military and intelligence operations. Some of the technologies discussed are embryonic, but the pace of development is difficult to predict, and this report provides a snapshot in time of the state of the technology domain.\nKey Findings\nThe three technology categories considered in this report have the potential to be used to enhance human performance, but at different points in time\nA much-hyped area is gene manipulation, which is the most nascent—research focuses on the potential to alleviate disease, and decades of research will be required before meaningful application to HPE should be expected. That said, some forms of genetic analysis can be helpful in understanding capabilities of people as they are today.\nAI also has long been associated with hype, and although related technologies are steadily improving, meaningful impacts on cognitive and other prostheses are expected to take five to ten years. These new prostheses will provide new channels of communication, along with associated vulnerabilities.\nThe IoB is already having an effect today; it will become more complex and capable over time. It is becoming both a source of signals and a target for cyberattacks.\nRecommendations\nUnderstanding when and where breakthroughs or setbacks have occurred—and when and where novel and even surprising applications have emerged—will require monitoring.\nRelevant program launches or terminations, awards of government grants or contracts, joint ventures and acquisitions, conferences and trade shows, patents, and publications are among the indicators to watch.\nIt will also be important to monitor the kinds of data that are intentionally and unintentionally collected, used, or emitted by HPE-related systems.

Completion of IOT&E is the last major test event before the U.S. Army makes the decision to move the program from low rate initial production to full rate production, allowing IBCS to be fielded around the world.\nBeginning in January, at White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), New Mexico, IBCS began a series of operational flight tests. Throughout the 10-month period, soldiers operated IBCS in complex test environments encompassing a broad spectrum of attack and defense scenarios under realistic operating conditions, stressing the system as never before, and under intense scrutiny by U.S. Army independent evaluators.\n“Throughout IOT&E, we’ve shown how IBCS enables the warfighter to make more informed and faster decisions,” said Christine Harbison, vice president and general manager, combat systems and mission readiness, Northrop Grumman. “IBCS is ready for today’s threats and those of the future, making Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2) a reality.”\nAcross two IO&TE flight tests at WSMR, IBCS detected, tracked, and intercept threats that included: a high speed, high performance tactical ballistic missile and two cruise missile surrogates during a stressing electronic attack.\nOnce fielded, IBCS will extend the battlespace beyond what a single sensor tied to a single effector can provide, allowing the use of a sensor or effector’s full range and enabling the warfighter to quickly see and act on data across the entire battlefield.\nNorthrop Grumman designed IBCS with a modular, open, and scalable system architecture that is foundational to integrating all available assets in the battlespace, regardless of source, service, or domain. Its architecture enables the efficient and affordable integration of current and future systems and extends the battlespace by disaggregating sensors and effectors. Through numerous successful tests and demonstrations, IBCS has validated the ability to connect and fuse multi-service sensor data to multi-service weapons, demonstrating JADC2 capabilities.\nNorthrop Grumman is a technology company, focused on global security and human discovery.

It was critical that KULR find a solution to eliminate this wasted energy to further support sustainable renewable energy platforms using battery technology,” he says. “It is critical these are operated with [the] highest efficiency possible to maximize the life of batteries.”\n“We measure vibrations with the mindset that vibrations represent the mechanical condition of the platform you are measuring, like helicopters, airplanes, machines, even racing cars,” says Norm Serrano, inventor of VibeTech’s technology and now KULR’s senior director, vibe control technologies.\n“When you feel vibrations, it has a direct relationship to mechanical condition. And the problem has always been how do you interpret these vibrations to know what they actually mean,” he says. “With the mindset of understanding that vibration represents the mechanical condition of this rotating disc, we then allow the vibration to determine what the ultimate blade track should be.” \nVibeTech developed its artificial intelligence (AI)-driven technology to automate the track and balance of helicopter rotors. The dynamic forces on rotors change with phase of flight from hover to high speed and there are multiple ways to adjust the blades: hub weights, trim tabs, pitch links and lead/lag dampers. Modern elastomeric bearings and composite blades make rotor balancing even more complex.\n“The adjustment made in smoothing the rotor system may be very nonlinear, which means the pitch link may respond one way on one tail number but differently on another tail number, even on the same type of aircraft, because things wear and tear differently,” Serrano says.\n“But the process to balance a rotor, what to adjust first and then the next adjustment, that stays linear. And that process changes from one type of aircraft to another.

We’re usually done by the third flight,” he says.\nVibeTech has been balancing PHI Aviation’s global fleet of helicopters for more than 30 years. It recently completed demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force, balancing the main rotors of SIkorsky HH-60 helicopters down to vibration levels of 0.09 ips (inches per second) up to never-exceed speed.\nThe technology has been tested on a drone. “The vibrations on drones are enormous, anywhere from 1.2-1.5 ips. Once we were able to get them down to the 0.0 levels we’re accustomed to, we were able to increase the life of the battery by about 12% and the lifting power by 50%,” Serrano says.\nUsing vibration data from sensors already on the aircraft—for the health and usage monitoring system or new or relocated sensors—the vibration reduction software can run on a laptop or in the cloud, so it can be deployed anywhere in the world, Cochran says. \n",

        "input": "A new type of solar cell based on heterojunctions between different crystalline phases of the same light-absorbing material boasts a maximum power conversion of 20.1% and is stable for long periods of time. The concept, developed by researchers at the Technische Universit?t Dresden (TUD) in Germany, could be applied to cells made from other so-called polymorphic material systems, as well as to other types of optoelectronic devices such as light-emitting diodes and photodetectors.\nModern solar cells often contain a heterojunction – a structure in which two components with different optoelectronic properties meet at an interface. The properties of these components are usually tuned by using different materials or by doping the same material so that one side of the junction has an excess of electrons (n-doped) while the other has an excess of positively-charged holes (p-doped).\nTwo polymorphs of caesium lead iodide\nResearchers led by Yana Vaynzof have now developed a new type of heterojunction solar cell that uses two polymorphs, or phases, of a single material: caesium lead iodide. This material is a perovskite and highly efficient at absorbing light at wavelengths in the Sun’s spectrum, and the optoelectronic properties of its gamma and beta phases are different. By placing the gamma-perovskite atop the beta-perovskite, the researchers succeeded in fabricating a solar cell that is much more efficient than cells based on single-phase perovskites.\nAccording to Vaynzof and colleagues, who report their work in Nature Energy, the top layer of gamma-perovskite improves the performance of the solar cells by passivating defects at the surface of the bottom beta-phase layer. These defects usually trap photoactivated charge carriers (electrons and holes), preventing them from propagating to the opposite side of the photovoltaic device and producing electric current.\nThe phase heterojunction also increases the cell’s performance in other ways, Vaynzof adds. “Light absorption in the phase heterojunction structure is enhanced as compared to each of the single phases, and the alignment between the energy levels of the two phases results in a beneficial energetic landscape with the solar cell to drive the charge carriers to be separated,” she explains.\n‘An entirely new concept for photovoltaics’\nThe TUD team made its solar cell by depositing the bottom beta-phase and top gamma-phase using techniques called solution processing and thermal evaporation, respectively. Both techniques require only moderate temperatures and combining them produces a sharp interface between the two phases. The phase heterojunction is also stable over long time periods.\n“Considering that phase heterojunction solar cells are an entirely new concept for photovoltaics, we foresee that such a concept may also be applied to other polymorphic materials systems” Vaynzof tells Physics World. “It is also possible that such a concept could be applied to other types of optoelectronic devices such as light-emitting diodes and photodetectors.”\nThe researchers are now exploring different phase heterojunction configurations for other perovskite compositions. They are also exploring alternative photovoltaic device architectures. “Importantly, we aim to use only thermal evaporation as the deposition method to enable the fabrication of multi-layered structures without the limitations that arise from the use of solvents in solution processing,” Vaynzof says. “Since thermal evaporation is a highly scalable, industrially-relevant method, this will facilitate the future integration of phase heterojunctions in industrial applications.”\n",

        "input": "A University of Minnesota Twin Cities-led team of scientists and engineers has developed a new method for making thin films of perovskite oxide semiconductors, a class of \"smart\" materials with unique properties that can change in response to stimuli like light, magnetic fields, or electric fields.\nThe discovery will allow researchers to harness these properties and even combine them with other emerging nano-scale materials to make better devices such as sensors, smart textiles, and flexible electronics.\nThe paper is published in Science Advances.\nProducing materials in thin-film form makes them easier to integrate into smaller components for electronic devices. Many thin films are made using a technique called epitaxy, which consists of placing atoms of a material on a substrate, or a template of sorts, to create a thin sheet of material, one atomic layer at a time. However, most thin films created via epitaxy are \"stuck\" on their host substrate, limiting their uses. If the thin film is detached from the substrate to become a freestanding membrane, it becomes much more functional.\nThe University of Minnesota-led team has found a new way to successfully create a membrane of a particular metal oxide—strontium titanate—and their method circumvents several issues that have plagued the synthesis of freestanding metal oxide films in the past.\n\"We have created a process where we can make a freestanding membrane of virtually any oxide material, exfoliate it, and then transfer it onto any subject of interest we want,\" said Bharat Jalan, a senior author on the paper and a professor and Shell Chair in the University of Minnesota Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science. \"Now, we can benefit from the functionality of these materials by combining them with other nano-scale materials, which would enable a wide range of highly functional, highly efficient devices.\"\nMaking freestanding membranes of \"smart\" oxide materials is challenging because the atoms are bonded in all three dimensions, unlike in a two-dimensional material, such as graphene. One method of making membranes in oxide materials is using a technique called remote epitaxy, which uses a layer of graphene as an intermediary between the substrate and the thin-film material.\nThis approach allows the thin-film oxide material to form a thin film and be peeled off, like a piece of tape, from the substrate, creating a freestanding membrane. However, the biggest barrier to using this method with metal oxides is that the oxygen in the material oxidizes the graphene on contact, ruining the sample.\nUsing hybrid molecular beam epitaxy, a technique pioneered by Jalan's lab at the University of Minnesota, the researchers were able to get around this issue by using titanium that was already bonded to oxygen. Plus, their method allows for automatic stoichiometric control, meaning they can automatically control the composition.\n\"We showed for the first time, and conclusively by doing several experiments, that we have a new method which allows us to make complex oxide while ensuring that graphene is not oxidized. That's a major milestone in synthesis science,\" Jalan said. \"And, we now have a way to make these complex oxide membranes with an automatic stoichiometric control. No one has been able to do that.\"\nThe materials scientists on Jalan's team worked closely with engineering researchers in University of Minnesota Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering Professor Steven Koester's lab, which focuses on making 2D materials.\n\"These complex oxides are a broad class of materials that have a lot of really important innate functions to them,\" said Koester, also a senior author of the study and the director of the Minnesota Nano Center at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities. \"Now, we can think about using them to make extremely small transistors for electronic devices, and in a wide array of other applications including flexible sensors, smart textiles, and non-volatile memories.\"\n",

Brad Cooper.\n“This means every partner and every sensor, collecting new data, adding it to an intelligent synthesis of around-the-clock inputs, encompassing thousands of images, from seabed to space, from ships, unmanned systems, subsea sensors, satellites, buoys and other persistent technologies,” Cooper said yesterday at the Surface Navy Association’s annual symposium.\n“Some may view this as an ambitious goal, but I believe it's achievable because of the people and partners and we have already come a long way in a very short period of time,” Cooper said.\nThe Navy launched Task Force 59 in Sept. 2021 to integrate unmanned systems and artificial intelligence into the fleet. Cooper told reporters that the task force aims to have a 100 unmanned surface vessel fleet throughout the Middle East by the end of this summer. Only about 20 of the 100 USV fleet will be U.S. systems and the rest will be from partner nations.\nMideast waters are dynamic and heavily trafficked, Cooper said. The commander detailed growing threats from Iran after the country attempted to confiscate U.S. unmanned vessels and used one-way attack aerial drones to target commercial ships -- the same “lethal capability” Iran has supplied to Russia for its attacks against Ukraine.\n“These situations clearly show how the threats emanating from Iran remain very real and they have our attention,” Cooper said.\n“No navy acting alone can possibly protect against all the threats, the region is simply too big. We believe the way to get after this is the two primary lines of effort: strengthen our partnerships and accelerate innovation,” he said.\nDigital Horizon, a recent three-week maritime exercise that featured an array of unmanned systems in the Middle East, was “a visible demonstration of the promise and the power of very rapid tech innovation,” according to the admiral.\nOne of the results from the exercise was the ability to create a single operational picture so one operator can command and control multiple unmanned systems on screen, Cooper said, termed a “Single Pane Of Glass” -- or SPOG.\nAccenture Federal Services, an IT-focus contractor, was tasked with delivering the SPOG capability during Digital Horizon. Navy operators were using the AFS software the entire time and the service aimed to reduce reliance on contractors throughout the exercise, Stephen Carlon, managing director of C4ISR, National Security Portfolio, at Accenture Federal Services told Inside Defense in an interview last month.\nTask Force 59 is using a contractor-owned, contractor-operated model for its platforms. The service will continue to use this model, netting together unclassified, commercial products since it’s “very effective,” Cooper said.\n“We provide Navy oversight -- obviously very close oversight. It’s a good teaming effort and I think for the near term, we're going to continue to use that,” Cooper said.\nThis model works because no information is retained on the platform -- it’s all sent to the cloud, Cooper added.\nLooking forward, Task Force 59 will be participating in the largest unmanned exercise of the year in February -- International Maritime Exercise 2023, according to the admiral.\n",

Because of this melting point, however, tungsten is difficult to use in Laser Beam or Electron Beam Powder Bed Fusion (PBF-LB or PBF-EB, respectively), while tungsten alloys are typically processed via these technologies and Directed Energy Deposition (DED) Additive Manufacturing.\nThe paper identified the issue of cracking as particularly relevant to the PBF-LB process as it relates to tungsten.

The 5% Ta mixture was shown to reduce grain size, though the 10% showed no further reduction.

We are running out of time,” Caroline Baxter, deputy assistant secretary of defense for force education and training, said today at theI/ITSEC2022 conference. “We are running out of time to rethink, to refresh and to transform military training… [Fiscal 2023] is really going to be the year of training in DoD. The engagement of leadership is really enabling my office to make some important and long overdue changes to the way that we approach and rapidly implement this shift.”\nWithin the next few months, a new military training executive steering group, which Baxter said will be a “three-star forum focused on designing and critically solving joint and tactical training challenges” will be established.\n“We’re trying to create a new paradigm for governing with training, for making sure that all of these efforts that might seem disparate are synchronized, unified, and all marching at the same pace in the same direction with the same vector,” she said. “So if we’re going to have to train as we fight across all levels, that’s going to be pretty complicated. So let’s start at the leadership level. The amount of attention to training right now is really quite unprecedented.”\nBaxter added that the war inUkrainehas shown why the training community needs to improve interoperability, saying no individual service or country will own the next fight.\n“Just look at what’s happening in Ukraine, the coalition of countries that are sharing weapons and tools and training tactics and techniques,” she said. “Ukrainian soldiers are learning as they train. It’s really striking example of why we as the training community need to improve our interoperability and fast. Combined and joint training enhances our ability to plan and execute responses improves our capabilities and fosters security cooperation. So that’s one of the many reasons why we are working to include allies and partners in the next iteration of the [Joint Operational Training Infrastructure Strategy]going forward.”\nImplementing the 2020 Joint Operational Training Strategy is one of many efforts on which Baxter’s office is focused,including partnering with the electromagnetic spectrum community to create realistic, contested and degraded EMS operations and fulfilling theEMS Superiority Strategy’straining and readiness goals. The office will also collaborate with DoD’s research and engineering office, academia and industry partners to develop low-cost threat emitters to create a realistic electronic warfare training environment.\nA cross-service data collection strategy, created by Baxter’s office, is also being implemented and will feed into existing DoD policy and budget processes to “inform and drive actionable decision making,” she said.\nEach of those initiatives will allow DoD to have a process to identify training gaps and coordinate current and future training activities and capabilities to fill them, Baxter said, while also allowing the training community “to continue focusing on great power competition without losing sight of those potential black swan events, as well as innovate ensuring data and requirements in the field feed into planning and acquisition pipelines.”\n",

        "input": "by Staff Writers\nLogan UT (SPX) Aug 23, 2022\nDigital continuity can synchronize all tools throughout the design-test-operate life-cycle, enabling an exponential increase in space mission efficiency. Leanspace has been conceived with digital continuity at its core, allowing to connect all ground software systems - from satellite design, test bench operations, satellite control, mission planning or ground station networks.\nNumerous software tools are typically required throughout a space mission; from the mission conceptualization and satellite design, to testing the hardware, to running operations. Still today, this technology stack consists of independent systems that don't talk to each other, requiring manual movement of data, limiting automation and forcing engineering teams to work with different data sets.\nIn the current context of commercialization of the space industry, where every organization strives to become more agile, reduce costs and increase efficiency, this is an ever increasing problem. The solution is digital continuity.\nWhat is Digital Continuity?\n\"Digital Continuity is the ability to move data across phases, tools and teams in the mission life-cycle\" said Stuart Gill, Product Manager at Leanspace.\nDigital continuity breaks down information silos by eliminating the interfaces between various tools. It allows faster design iterations by expediting feedback cycles, and enables better collaboration between teams by ensuring everyone is working on the most up-to-date information.\nFor startups, this means having scalable systems that seamlessly grow as they do, and future-proofing their business, for established organizations it means increasing efficiency, reducing costs and enabling agility.\nThe live demonstration showed the power of digital continuity applied to a common space use case.\nDuring the live demonstration, we followed a fictional Earth Observation company that had just finished designing its next generation of satellites using Valispace. As their design environment is connected to their operational environment built in Leanspace, they were able to move all design data across both tools, in a quick, reliable and cost-efficient manner. Once there, they just needed to configure their assets and add any necessary operational parameters.\nWhat normally would take weeks of cumbersome manual work to redefine the same assets, properties and data structures all over again, was done in just a few clicks. The native integration assures a fast, reliable and lossless data transfer, protecting against human error.\nDigital continuity can synchronize all tools throughout the design-test-operate life-cycle, enabling an exponential increase in space mission efficiency. Leanspace has been conceived with digital continuity at its core, allowing to connect all ground software systems - from satellite design, test bench operations, satellite control, mission planning or ground station networks.\n",

        "input": "Fleet Readiness Center East (FRCE) marked a milestone in its support of the F-35B Lightning II aircraft when it successfully completed verification of the laser shock peening process and returned the first aircraft to undergo the procedure to the fleet.\nLaser shock peening strengthens the aircraft’s frame without adding any additional material or weight, which would reduce its capability by limiting its fuel or weapons carrying capacity. The procedure helps extend the life expectancy of the fifth-generation F-35B fighter, which is the short takeoff-vertical landing (STOVL) variant flown by the U.S. Marine Corps. Verification of the process provides quality control by confirming it meets system-level requirements through a combination of inspection, analysis, demonstration and testing.\n“The laser shock peening modification is essential to extending the life of the F-35B STOVL variant, and the ability to complete this procedure successfully allows FRC East to support this critical workload,” said FRCE Commanding Officer Col. Thomas A. Atkinson. “Standing up this strategic capability positions FRC East as a readiness multiplier for the future of Marine Corps aviation, and I’m proud of the hard work and dedication shown by the team in achieving verification of the process and returning the first laser shock peened F-35 aircraft to the fleet.”\nFRCE completed construction on a $6 million, purpose-built laser shock peening facility in August 2019, and inducted the first F-35 to undergo the procedure in June 2020. Achieving the verification milestone required a cooperative effort by a multidisciplinary team that spans FRCE, the F-35 Joint Program Office, the aircraft manufacturer and the contractors that developed and conduct the laser peening procedure.\n“The big picture here is that we set up a capability that has never been stood up before. We made STOVL history by completing verification of the laser shock peening procedure on the first Marine Corps aircraft inducted for the modification and returned to the fleet,” said Jeanie Holder, the F-35 Joint Program Office induction manager at FRCE. “As our local enterprise, we accomplished a lot to get the building stood up, get the equipment set up, and then roll the first aircraft into something that has never been done before.”\nIke Rettenmair, the interim Fixed Wing Division director at FRCE, said he agreed the teamwork between the venture’s stakeholders – FRC East, the F-35 Joint Program Office, Lockheed Martin, Curtiss-Wright Surface Technologies and Northrup Grumman Corporation – helped make the effort successful.\n“We have a great partnership between the working entities, and that makes all the difference,” he added.\nBrent Dane, director of laser technology at Curtiss-Wright, said the company is proud to be part of this milestone.\n“Curtiss-Wright Surface Technology takes great pride in our contributions to returning the first laser peened F-35B to active service and we look forward to continued support of the F-35 fleet with this unique laser strengthening process,” he said. “With the ever growing applications of this technology to critical military assets, we are honored to contribute to our nation’s defense and to help guard the safety of the warfighter.”\nHaving the laser shock peening process verified means FRCE and its partners conducted the modification for the first time and was then troubleshot, streamlined and improved, said Wes Klor, overhaul and repair supervisor on the F-35 modification line at FRCE.\n“Our team got in there and completed the modification according to the engineering instruction, found any issues or trouble spots and documented these areas,” Klor explained.\n“The artisans will take the instructions and work them, step by step, until they get to a point where they see an area for correction or improvement,” he continued. “Then they work with engineering to make changes to the engineering instruction on the spot and test out these solutions. Finally, they repeat the entire process successfully.”\nVerification validates the engineering instruction, the tooling, the supply system and other factors associated with the process, noted Scott Nelson, F-35 Joint Program Office induction manager at FRCE.\n“Verification makes the process repeatable,” he said. “You could take that instruction now and go complete this modification anywhere in the world if you had an LSP facility because all the steps are correct and in the right order. You have everything you need to do it.”\nThe verification marks FRCE as the first and only facility in the world to capable of conducting the laser shock peening modification on an F-35 aircraft; a second facility, Ogden Air Logistics Complex at Hill Air Force Base, Utah, is scheduled to come online in the near future, and FRCE has served as a model for successful standup, Holder said.\n“We found all the potholes. We have broken ground for them to be able to fall in behind us and not have to do it the hard way,” she said. “It was always intended for FRC East to lead the way.”\nThe Air Force facility has even sent members of its workforce to observe and learn from the work done at FRCE, Rettenmair added.\n“They’ve sent artisans here to see what we do,” he said. “They’ve sent planners and business office staff just to learn from this laser shock peening verification effort, and we’re willing to reach out to them and help them be successful.”\nThe skill and enthusiasm of the artisans on FRCE’s F-35 modification line make this type of success possible at the depot and beyond, Rettenmair added.\n“The commitment of the team is unmatched,” he said. “The F-35 team as a whole is just hard to touch, with their loyalty and dedication to the success of the program. It’s great to see.”\nAll told, almost 15,000 labor hours went into verifying the process, Holder said, which sets FRCE up for success when it comes to working laser shock peening modifications for select F-35B aircraft in the future.\n“This is going to be a major part of the FRC East F-35 workload for the next five to seven years,” she explained. “FRC East is the only facility that can do it besides the complex at Ogden, which will be providing the service on a limited, overflow basis because of their work on the F-35A, which is the conventional takeoff and landing variant flown by the Air Force. So it’s huge. Truly, in my opinion, it is a big deal.”\nFRCE is the lead site for depot-level maintenance on the F-35B Lightning II and has conducted modifications and repair on the Marine Corps’ short takeoff-vertical landing variant of the aircraft since 2013. The facility has also worked with the F-35A (conventional takeoff and landing) and F-35C (carrier) variants.\nFRCE is North Carolina's largest maintenance, repair, overhaul and technical services provider, with more than 4,000 civilian, military and contract workers. Its annual revenue exceeds $1 billion. The depot provides service to the fleet while functioning as an integral part of the greater U.S. Navy; Naval Air Systems Command; and Commander, Fleet Readiness Centers.\n",

In Nature Communications, the researchers report how, by means of a soundwave, they switch individual photons on a chip back and forth between two outputs at gigahertz frequencies. This method, demonstrated here for the first time, can now be used for acoustic quantum technologies or complex integrated photonic networks.\nLight waves and soundwaves form the technological backbone of modern communications. While glass fibers with laser light form the World Wide Web, nanoscale soundwaves on chips process signals at gigahertz frequencies for wireless transmission between smartphones, tablets or laptops. One of the most pressing questions for the future is how these technologies can be extended to quantum systems, to build up secure (i.e., tap-free) quantum communication networks.\n\"Light quanta or photons play a very central role in the development of quantum technologies,\" says physicist Prof. Hubert Krenner, who heads the study in Münster and Augsburg. \"Our team has now succeeded in generating individual photons on a chip the size of a thumbnail and then controlling them with unprecedented precision, precisely clocked by means of soundwaves,\" he says.\nDr. Mauricio de Lima, who researches at the University of Valencia and coordinates the work being done there, adds, \"The functional principle of our chip was known to us as regards conventional laser light, but now, using light quanta, we have succeeded in making the long wished-for breakthrough towards quantum technologies.\"\nIn their study, the researchers fabricated a chip which is equipped with minute \"conducting paths\" for light quanta—so-called waveguides. These are approximately 30 times thinner than a human hair. In addition, this chip contained quantum light sources, so-called quantum dots.\nDr. Matthias Wei? from the University of Münster carried out the optical experiments and adds: \"These quantum dots, just a few nanometers in size, are islands inside the waveguides which emit light as individual photons. The quantum dots are included in our chip and so we don't have to use complicated methods to generate individual photons by means of another source.\"\nDr. Dominik Bühler, who designed the quantum chips as part of his Ph.D. at the University of Valencia, points out how fast the technology is: \"By using nanoscale soundwaves, we are able to directly switch the photons on the chip back and forth between two outputs at unprecedented speed during their propagation in the waveguides.\"\nThe researchers consider their results to be a milestone on the way towards hybrid quantum technologies as they combine three different quantum systems: quantum light sources in the form of quantum dots, the light quanta created, and phonons (the quantum particles in the soundwave). The hybrid quantum chips—designed at the University of Valencia and manufactured at the Paul Drude Institute of Solid-State Electronics using quantum dots produced at the Technical University of Munich—exceeded the expectations which the research team had.\nThe international team has taken a further decisive step towards acoustic quantum technologies. \"We are already working flat out to enhance our chip so that we can program the quantum state of the photons as we wish, or even control several photons with different colors between four or more outputs,\" says Dr. Mauricio de Lima, with a view to the future.\nProf. Hubert Krenner adds, \"We benefit here from a unique strength which our nanoscale soundwaves have: as these waves propagate virtually loss-free on the surface of the chip, we can neatly control almost as many waveguides as we want with just one single wave—and to an extremely high degree of precision.\"\n",

Team Miles won prizes in every CubeQuest ground tournaments by proving, for example, the merit of its engineering designs, plans, analysis and models.\nFaler co-invented the team’s patent-pending water-fueled plasma thruster. Twelve of the thrusters, mounted on the Team Miles cubesat, are controlled by a custom-built radiation-tolerant computer. The computer continuously evaluates the performance of each thruster.\n“It’s running a small experiment on itself to figure out which thrust heads are behaving best,” Faler said.\nA subsystem to enable the six-unit cubesat to communicate with Earth from deep space also was invented by Faler.\nCommunicating from at least 3 million kilometers from Earth is one of the technical objective of the CubeQuest Challenge. Competitors who prove that feat will share a $1.5 million prize.\n“There was no technology that was capable of providing small satellite communications at that kind of distance, because it’s going to the moon and beyond,” said Brad Berkson, Miles Space chief operating officer. “He had to invent ways to communicate.”\nMiles Space, a Florida startup founded by Team Miles members, is the commercial outlet for the technology. Executives are not yet ready to name their customers, but Faler said, “we have other in-space demo opportunities lining up right now.”\nFaler has been working on his unique propulsion system since the early 2000s. Some elements of it have been patented. Others patents are pending.\n“It’s completely novel and what’s been interesting is the massive denial on the part of the experts, who say it is physically impossible and it can’t work,” Berkson said.\nThe problem is that the propulsion equation most engineers remember is an abbreviated one.\n“It leaves out a pressure term,” Faler said. “They use the shorthand version to relate thrust to power and fuel economy. When you plug in the full equation, we’re about 5 percent efficient.”\nTeam Miles has conducted extensive testing of its cubesat on the ground.\n“We know it can fly if the batteries are dead,” Faler said. “We know it will keep flying if the software hiccups and the computer reboots. We know that if the radio signal is weak, we can still recover the signal here on the ground.”\nStill, the prospect of the cubesat finally reaching orbit is both exciting and terrifying, Faler said.\n",

        "input": "The test took place on November 17 in New Mexico, with a drone as a stand-in for a cruise missile.\nThe recent test used a drone as a stand-in for a cruise missile. Above, a drone used during a different test in Palau in June, 2022. US Army / Nicholas Chopp\nStopping a missile is a complicated operation that takes a team of machines. The Army, charged with protecting soldiers in the field from enemy attacks, is testing a system that can coordinate sensors and interceptors to better accomplish this task. On November 17, the Army successfully used this new system to shoot down a cruise-missile stand-in at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico.\nTo do this, soldiers from the Army’s 43rd Air Defense Artillery Regiment used two Patriot and Sentinel radars, Patriot missile launchers, and Patriot interceptors, all coordinated through a new command system. This connective tissue between sensors and interceptors is the Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System, or IBCS. It’s a way for the Army to coordinate radars and missile interceptors across a broad area, comprehensively detecting incoming threats and then making sure those missiles are stopped, without overcommitting interceptors and depleting vital stockpiles.\nThis endeavor “had a test objective of demonstrating Army Integrated Air & Missile Defense capability to execute [a] kill chain against a ground launched cruise missile surrogate,” the Army said in a release.\nIn other words, the soldiers used the sensors and interceptors to track and destroy a target drone that was imitating a cruise missile in flight. While the test specifically used Patriot and Sentinel radars, and Patriot interceptors, the premise is that the IBCS can incorporate a host of useful existing and future sensors, as well as any kinds of interceptors the Army might field.\n“Preliminary indications are that the planned flight test objectives against the cruise missile threat were achieved, and the target was successfully intercepted,” said the release.\nCruise missiles are a durable threat on modern battlefields, in part because their low trajectory and high degree of maneuverability mean they can be hard to detect at a distance. Patriot missiles, which are deployed in batteries with fire command stations and radars to track targets, have been used to defend against cruise missiles for decades, though the missiles drastically underperformed at intercepting targets during the 1991 Persian Gulf War.\nOne way to improve targeting is to incorporate and coordinate more sensors across a wider field, so that missiles can be detected earlier and the most relevant ways to stop them can be brought to bear against the target. Sometimes, these tools for stopping weapons will be missiles, like the Patriot interceptors, or the older HAWK missiles the US is preparing to send to Ukraine. \nOther ways of stopping an attack may be rockets, like the Vampire anti-air and anti-drone system. Laser weapons, like one tested by PopSci, are another component of modern anti-missile tech, and could be incorporated into a command system.\nThere are many ways to stop a missile, or a drone, in flight. Grouped together, jammers, guns, missiles, lasers, and other answers to aerial threats are called “effectors,” in military and industry parlance. The effect can be everything from explosion by missile, puncture by bullet, melting by laser, electronic disruption by jammer, but what is essential to the IBCS is that a commander has the sensors that can say where the attack is and the tools to stop it. \n“Once fielded, IBCS will extend the battlespace beyond what a single sensor tied to a single effector can provide, allowing the use of a sensor or effector’s full range and enabling the warfighter to quickly see and act on data across the entire battlefield,” said Northrop Grumman, maker of IBCS, in a release.\nMany legacy weapon systems are designed to work with a specific sensor, making a self-contained and compact kit that matched the capabilities and limits of the technology at the time of introduction. It also meant that commanders in the field were limited to working within that system’s information and weapons, even if another system could see the same target. By designing IBCS to incorporate information across sensors, it can match the Army’s desired plug-and-play information environment of the future, where the tools on hand are used to share information, and then the coordinating node matches signal to weapon.\nThe testing of IBCS at White Sands started in January, and over 10 months soldiers learned how to use the system in a range of scenarios designed to resemble what might be seen in combat. This included two flight tests prior to November 17 where “IBCS detected, tracked, and intercept threats that included: a high speed, high performance tactical ballistic missile and two cruise missile surrogates during a stressing electronic attack,” according to Northop Grumman. \nProvided the system can withstand electronic attack in the field as well as it did in testing, the coordinated system should let the Army better protect soldiers from a range of incoming assaults, using whatever tools are on hand to build a defense that’s stronger together.\n",

Doug Lamborn (R-CO), the new head of the authorization subcommittee that provides oversight of Pentagon hypersonic weapons policy, said he plans to use the panel's influence to speed work on the portfolio of projects that include both ultra-fast, maneuvering glide vehicles and air-breathing missiles.\n“My top priority as chairman of the strategic forces subcommittee is to accelerate our hypersonic capabilities -- both offensive and defensive,” Lamborn said during the Feb. 7 House Armed Services Committee hearing on the “pressing threat” of China to U.S. national defense.\nLamborn said he is “extremely concerned” by what he believes is the “anemic pace” at which the Defense Department is pursuing hypersonic capabilities.\n“I'm also troubled by the current limited plan to field these systems,” he added.\nThe Pentagon has an $18.7 billion portfolio of offensive hypersonic weapons projects, according to a recent Congressional Budget Office report. Separately, the Missile Defense Agency is developing a hypersonic defense capability that will likely cost billions of dollars.\nDOD’s first-generation hypersonic weapons -- such as the Army’s Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon, the Navy’s Conventional Prompt Strike and the Air Force’s Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon -- are slated for fielding beginning this year.\nThe recent CBO report raised issues for policymakers regarding the efficacy of paying a premium for unique capabilities of hypersonic weapons, compared to technology currently available, including intermediate-range ballistic missiles armed with conventionally armed, maneuverable reentry vehicles.\nDuring the Feb. 7 House committee hearing, witnesses offered divergent views on the importance of hypersonic technology to the U.S. ability to counter China.\nHarry Harris, a retired admiral and former commander of what is now U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, said it is important for the U.S. to be armed with hypersonic weapons as China, which began fielding them in 2020.\n“I’ll just say we are shooting behind the Peking Duck on hypersonics,” Harris said. “China is ahead of us in that regard. We need an offensive capability and we need a defensive capability.”\nMelanie Sisson, a security, strategy and technology fellow at the Brookings Institute, said she believes other U.S. military technology investments are a higher priority.\n“My perspective is that the priority investment in terms of technology . . . should be less on those large and very exquisite kinds of platforms and capabilities,” Sisson said. “I favor much more strongly the ability to disperse and be mobile and the [artificial intelligence]-enabled technologies that support those kinds of missions.\n\"This is not to say we shouldn't be continuing to invest in and learn from research into hypersonics and the development thereof, it's just not to my mind the first priority,” she continued.\nIn 2021, the Pentagon assessed that China fielded a hypersonic strike weapon -- the DF-17, a maneuvering glide body paired with a medium-range ballistic missile with an estimated range of 1,500 miles.\nThe United States does not plan to field a similar capability until later this year, with the Army’s first battery of the Long Range Hypersonic Weapon which will carry a common-hypersonic glide body on a two-stage booster.

Globally, about 1.27 million people die as a result of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\nLead researcher, UniSA's Dr. Muhammed Awad, says the new light therapy will be a game-changer for millions of people worldwide.\n\"Golden staph and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are both highly transmissible bacteria, commonly found on people's skin. But if they get into the blood, they can lead to sepsis or even death,\" Dr. Awad says.\n\"Patients in hospitals—particularly those with wounds or catheters, or those on ventilators—have a higher risk of getting these bacteria, and while antibiotics may help, their extensive use has led to waves of microbial resistance, often making them ineffective.\n\"Our photodynamic technology works differently, harnessing the energy of light to generate highly reactive oxygen molecules that eradicate microbial cells and kill deadly bacteria, without harming human cells.\"\nThe researchers tested the antimicrobial photodynamic therapy on recalcitrant bacterial infections caused by antibiotic resistant strains of golden staph and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\nSenior researcher, UniSA's Professor Clive Prestidge, says that the technology has some key advantages over conventional antibiotics and other light therapies.\n\"The new therapy is created in an oil that that is painted on a wound as a lotion. When laser light is applied to the lotion, it creates reactive oxygen species which act as an alternative to conventional antibiotics,\" Prof. Prestidge says.\n\"Current photoactive compounds also suffer from poor water-solubility which mean that they have limited clinical application.\n\"Our approach uses food grade lipids to construct nanocarriers for the photoactive compound which improves its solubility and antibacterial efficiency far beyond that of an unformulated compound.\n\"These molecules target multiple bacterial cells at once, preventing bacteria from adapting and becoming resistant. So, it's a far more effective and robust treatment.\n\"Importantly, the human skin cells involved in the wound healing process showed enhanced viability, while the antibiotic resistant bacteria were entirely eradicated.\"\nThe consequences of not managing superbugs are high.

This includes soldiers moving the equipment onto C-17s and exercising its use, says Lt. Gen. Robert Rasch, the Army’s director of hypersonics, directed energy, space and rapid acquisition.\nThe Army and U.S. Navy are progressing through a test phase of the ground service’s LRHW and the sea service’s Intermediate Range Conventional Prompt Strike, which share the two-stage booster, common hypersonic glide body and canister. The system has experienced a series of test setbacks, including a June 2022 test failure of the full-up system, known as Joint Flight Campaign 1. Though the test was not successful, for still undisclosed reasons, it still provided a “tremendous amount of learning,” Rasch says. That, coupled with the first successful test of the Navy-produced two-stage rocket motor in August, gives the two services the chance to add in piece by piece the overall system.\nRasch says the two upcoming tests, JFC2 and JFC3, could also experience anomalies, which will be assessed as the Army wants to manage its risk going forward.\n“I would say the risk, obviously, it’s just the fact that we’re going fast,” he said during a panel hosted by Defense News at the annual Association of the United States Army conference. “I mean, we are doing a fair amount of concurrency on this effort, so we’re assuming what I would call the appropriate amount of risk, but probably more so than we would normally assume in a traditional program of record.”\nWhile hypersonic weapons have emerged as a need across all services, there have been questions about the industrial base’s capacity to produce and the Pentagon’s ability to test. The Army’s plan is to field three full batteries of the LRHW missiles. Rasch says the Army’s goal—along with the Navy’s Conventional Prompt Strike and the U.S. Air Force’s Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon, plus other smaller-scale hypersonic systems—will provide a large market for industry.\n",

The drones will be used to assist in hypersonic missile testing over the Pacific or Atlantic oceans. U.S. Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., said the SkyRange program has 16 corporate partners and seven armed services and defense agencies. Some partners include Northrop Grumman, General Atomics, Honeywell, BlueHalo, Stratolaunch and many others.\n“We’re right here building it. We’re the heart and soul of this whole new concept (in North Dakota),” Hoeven said.\nU.S. Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said while hypersonic missiles were invented in the United States, other countries have “put a lot more behind it than we have” since then.\n“The reality is that we’re catching up and we’re getting further ahead,” he said, adding the Block 30s will be a “game changer” compared to lining up ships in the ocean.\nA hypersonic missile launches like a rocket into outer space and then comes back down and quickly glides toward its target, Cramer said.\nIn 2021, China tested a nuclear-capable hypersonic missile that circled the globe, missing its target slightly, the Financial Times reported last year. Cramer said the test was “eye-opening for a lot of people,” adding that Russia has also conducted many hypersonic missile tests.\nThis SkyRange program will be key for future testing of hypersonic missiles for the country, Cramer said, noting it involves the armed forces agencies, as well as intelligence and technology agencies.\n“It’s critical to the entire nation,” he said.\nDuring the ceremony, Test Resource Management Center Director George Rumford noted the importance of testing and the potential role this information could have in future conflicts, adding that “this is where wars are won.”\nCramer said he believes that “much of what Russia is experiencing in Ukraine is because they didn’t do a lot of this.” He said he believes Russia doesn’t pay attention to the same level of detail as the U.S. when it comes to testing and preparation.\n“They’re making mistakes we don’t ever want our military to ever make,” he said.\nHoeven said the new SkyRange program will provide essential data and information that will allow the United States to “move ahead of the competition.”\n“This revolutionizes how we develop hypersonics,” he said.\nThe aircraft, Cramer said, are retired and otherwise would likely “head to the boneyard” if they couldn’t be used by another agency in some other way.\n“Now they’re value added,” Cramer said. “This is huge. This is now a major contributor in a way that they weren’t initially intended to be.”\nGrand Forks Mayor Brandon Bochenski, Grand Forks County Commissioner Chairman Tom Falck and a number of other local leaders were in attendance on Wednesday.\nFollowing the announcement, Hoeven and Cramer participated in a Community Leaders SkyRange Fleet Expansion information session at Minnkota Power to discuss the economic and employment impact on the greater Grand Forks community and northeast North Dakota.\n",

Photograph: Matt Cardy/Getty Images\nThe owner of one of the UK’s six nuclear power plants has said it will not extend its life beyond a planned shutdown in summer, despite officials raising concerns over the danger of blackouts in the months that follow.\nThe French-owned EDF Energy sent a memo to staff on Monday in which it said it would not postpone the closure of the two reactors at Hinkley Point B in Somerset, which are scheduled to be shut down on 8 July and 1 August.\nThe closure of the plant will remove nearly a gigawatt of power generationcapacity from the UK’s system – enough to supply 1.5m homes – before a winter in which the war in Ukraine is expected to weigh heavily on electricity supplies.\nThe government has played down fears of power cuts later this year, after it emerged that officials had modelled a “reasonable worst-case scenario” that could include millions of households being forced to limit their electricity consumption at peak times.\nThat modelling, which was first reported by the Times, included an option to extend Hinkley Point B, something mooted by experts and politicians for months. But it is understood the government had not made any formal request for EDF to keep the reactors open.\nThe government is scrambling to secure enough electricity to maintain buffers during the winter as households struggle with a cost of living crisis driven by energy prices that are expected to increase further in the autumn.\nLast week the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, wrote to the National Grid’s electricity system operator, asking it to work with the owners of coal-fired power plants that were due to closed down in September to extend their operating lives. This was despite the government’s commitment to rapidly phase out the heavily polluting fuel.\nChris Philp, a culture minister who does not have oversight of the energy industry, told Times Radio on Monday morning that Kwarteng was considering whether Hinkley Point B might continue beyond its “planned end of life”.\nBut later in the day EDF wrote to staff: “Although it is technically feasible to extend operations [at the nuclear plant] for up to six months, the time required to do this and to be confident we would be ready for winter operating has now run out.”\nThe memo, which was revealed by the Financial Times, added that an extension would involve compiling a detailed safety case that would have to be approved by the UK’s nuclear regulator.\nA government source said any decision to apply for an extension would be a matter for EDF and the regulator, and added that the government had secured enough power capacity even without extending the operation of the coal or nuclear plants.\nHowever, industry sources with knowledge of the matter said it was very likely that EDF would require a written request from a minister before deciding to go through the laborious process of submitting a new safety case to the regulator, which is run at arm’s length from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS).\n“On Hinkley B, there is no technical reason it can’t continue to operate, if they can satisfy the regulators. For EDF, it will be fundamentally an economic decision,” said Malcolm Grimston, an honorary senior research fellow at Imperial College London’s centre for energy policy and technology.\nInsiders in the sector expressed concern over the lack of time the government had left to take any action, with one saying: “They’ve left it right to the very end, and we’re not sure if it’s possible.”\nSue Ferns, the senior deputy general secretary of the Prospect union, which represents engineers including those who work in the nuclear industry, said: “All options to prevent energy blackouts this winter must be explored.\n“The government must ask nuclear power plant operators to urgently explore safely extending the life of reactors due to be decommissioned in the coming months, including Hinkley Point B, which is otherwise due to come offline this summer.”\nA spokesperson for Boris Johnson said: “Neither the government or National Grid expect power cuts this winter.” Sources at BEIS also suggested the prospect of rolling blackouts was “very unlikely”. EDF declined to comment.\nA government spokesperson said: “Any extensions to operational dates for the UK’s nuclear power stations are a matter for the operator of the stations, EDF and the regulator the Office of Nuclear Regulation, which are based on safety considerations.\n",

The C802 derivatives are known as Noor, Ghader, and Ghadir, with ranges reportedly of 120 km, 200 km and 300 km, respectively. In addition to the development and deployment of these systems, Iranian CDCMs continue to evolve in all categories including, range, speed, flight profile, autonomy, seeker, and destructiveness.\nThe Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Aerospace Forces (IRGC ASF) controls Iran’s ballistic missile forces. The IRGC ASF has advertised several ballistic missile variants with the capability to target ships. The variants include the Khalij-e Fars, Hormuz-1 and Hormuz-2 missiles, which reportedly have a range of 300 km and are equipped with terminal seekers, one of which is anti-radiation homing (ARH).\n",

The young leader reportedly expressed satisfaction with the drill and stressed \"the need to further increase the capability\" of North Korean armed forces on its forefront and western front.\nThe US Department of Defense confirmed the missile launches to CNN.\nPeople watch a TV showing a file photo of North Korea&#39;s weapon systems during a news program at the Seoul Railway Station in Seoul, South Korea.\nPeople watch a TV showing a file photo of North Korea's weapon systems during a news program at the Seoul Railway Station in Seoul, South Korea.\nSouth Korea's President Moon Jae-in said North Korea may have launched the projectiles out of dissatisfaction with the outcome of the latest North Korea-US denuclearization talks at the Summit in Hanoi that ended without agreement earlier this year.\nMoon told South Korea's public broadcaster, KBS, that the launch of what South Korea's military suspects were short-range missiles might be an attempt by North Korea to \"pressure\" and \"push forward the denuclearization dialogue in the direction they want\" and to \"urge for [renewed] talks soon.\"\nKusong has been the site of Pyongyang's missile tests in the past, including a May 2017 test of a KN-17 intermediate range missile which traveled almost 500 miles before splashing down in the Sea of Japan/East Sea, hitting the water about 60 miles from Vladivostok in eastern Russia, according to US officials.\n\"The US and South Korean intelligence authority is conducting analysis for additional information,\" JCS said in a statement. \"Our military has currently heightened its surveillance and alertness against possible additional launches, whilst maintaining combat readiness in close coordination with the US.\"\nBlue House spokesperson Ko Min-jung, from the official residence of the South Korean President, said it is \"very worried\" about the projectile launch, saying it \"does not help in improving inter-Korean relations.\"\nSouth Korea said it &quot;suspected&quot; North Korea had launched &quot;two short-range missiles.&quot;\nSouth Korea said it \"suspected\" North Korea had launched \"two short-range missiles.\"\nThursday's firing comes less than a week after North Korea tested several new weapons systems, the first confirmed launches of their kind since 2017.\nNorth Korean state media reported that the launches conducted on Saturday were part of a \"strike drill\" to \"check the operating ability of large-caliber long-range multiple rocket launchers and tactical guided weapons.\"\nBut some weapons experts who analyzed the images of Saturday's launch released by North Korea say that Pyongyang may have test-fired a new, more advanced type of short-range ballistic missile -- the type of weapon that in theory could carry a nuclear warhead.\nMichael Elleman, a missile defense expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, wrote in a piece for North Korean specialty site 38 North that the weapon bore similarities to a Russian ballistic missile called Iskander.\nRegardless of what was fired, analysts worry that an uptick in weapons testing from the North Koreans could impact nuclear negotiations with the United States and South Korea. Talks between the three countries have been on the rocks since a February meeting between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ended abruptly and without an agreement.\nNorth Korea has been particularly vocal in its opposition to recent joint military drills between the US and South Korea. Seoul and Washington previously held large-scale military exercises in the spring, but this year chose to scale those back to \"reduce tension\" with North Korea.\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in and Kim agreed at a summit with Kim last year to \"make joint efforts to alleviate the acute military tension and practically eliminate the danger of war on the Korean Peninsula.\"\nMoon and Kim's meeting was part of a flurry of diplomacy intended to reduce tensions on the Peninsula, as Washington and Pyongyang traded heated threats amid North Korea's repeated missile and nuclear tests.\nNorth Korea's test pause is among the most important factors that has enabled negotiations between Seoul, Pyongyang and Washington. But a renewed round of missile launches could force the US to adjust course, as Trump has hinted that it could imperil the progress made between the two sides.\n\"I'm not in a rush, I don't want to rush anybody, I just don't want testing. As long as there's no testing, we're happy,\" Trump said ahead of his February summit with Kim.\nTrump's top diplomat in charge of North Korea, Stephen Biegun, arrived in Seoul yesterday for meetings with his South Korean counterparts.\nCorrection: A previous version of this article stated that one projectile had been launched from Sino-ri, citing South Korea's Defense Ministry.

        "input": "In recent years, electronics engineers have been trying to broaden the pool of available semiconducting materials, to enable the development of a wider range of devices. One emerging class of semiconductors are amorphous oxide semiconductors (AOSs), which are semiconductors based on oxides of post-transition metals.\nThese semiconductors can have several advantageous properties, including the ability to be deposited at low temperatures and across large surfaces, as well as a high flexibility and carrier mobility. These advantages would make them particularly suitable for creating low-cost and large-area devices, such flat-screen displays. Nonetheless, so far these materials have had a series of limitations that prevented them from replacing existing polycrystalline silicon technologies on a large scale.\nResearchers at Tokyo Institute of Technology have recently carried out a study aimed at examining some of these limitations more closely. Their paper, published in Nature Electronics, shows that the sensitivity of AOSs to externally introduced impurities and defects is highly dependent on the location of the so-called conduction-band minimum (CBM).\n\"In 2004, the first amorphous oxide semiconductor (AOS), IGZO, TFT was demonstrated by our institute, in a project led by Prof. Hosono,\" Jungwan Kim, one of the researchers who carried out the study, told Phys.org. \"Since I joined the current group in 2012, I mainly studied the electronic structure, doping mechanism and defects of AOSs. In 2017, in a study on amorphous gallium oxide (a-Ga2Ox), we found that energy levels and the relevant doping abilities of AOSs significantly differ according to their chemical composition.\"\nBased on their previous findings, Kim and his colleagues concluded that the number of donors (e.g., oxygen vacancy defects or hydrogens) in AOSs does not impact the carrier density. For instance, a-Ga2Ox film possesses the carrier density of only 1015 cm-3, even it contains same number of hydrogens as the amorphous InSnZnO (a-ITZO), which has a carrier density of 1020 cm-3. These observations inspired the researchers to examine the correlation between the electronic structure of AOSs and their doping ability further.\n\"Our explorations ultimately led to the achievement outlined in Nature Electronics,\" Kim explained. \"Most notably, we found that a charge transfer occurs between AOSs and unintended impurities and the charge transfer is strongly governed by the energy levels of the materials.\"\nThe researchers found that the electron mobility of AOSs can be tuned by altering their chemical composition. In their experiments, Kim and his colleagues used ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) to determine the energy levels in an AOS, for instance identifying the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) levels.\n\"In general, as the indium (In) or Tin (Sn) content increases, the electron mobility increases,\" Kim explained. \"The mobility-stability can thus be easily compared by investigating the different chemical composition systems.\"\nThe recent experiments carried out by Kim and his colleagues showed that a charge transfer occurs between AOSs and unintended, externally introduced impurities. Moreover, this charge transfer appears to be strongly influenced by the materials' energy levels.\nTypically, it is rare and unadvisable for impurities to remain in materials that are used to fabricate electronics. However, due to their low temperature processes, which are also advantageous, AOSs are particularly sensitive to impurities.\n\"This aspect of AOSs sets them apart from conventional Si-based electronics,\" Kim said.\n\"I feel that we are too used to conventional Si-based electronics. Much more different viewpoints should be prepared for low-temperature electronics. In this case, the discovered impurity was CO-related impurities which donate electrons to AOSs under the negative gate bias stress condition.\"\nCO-related impurities are a type of impurities that can be easily avoided and prevented when fabricating electronics on a large-scale. The recent findings gathered by this team of researchers thus suggest that attaining better performing thin-film transistors (TFTs) based on AOSs could be possible when using advanced manufacturing equipment.\nNonetheless, the team suspects that there might be additional impurities and defects affecting the charge transfer of AOSs. They thus plan to conduct further studies examining the impact of different types of impurities on these materials' properties and performance.\n\"Oxide TFT manufacturing processes, what kinds of impurities are generated and how much of these impurities are incorporated in the AOSs must be thoroughly investigated,\" Kim said. \"For more applications such as logic circuits, memory, fully transparent electronics, there remains many challenging tasks. In our next studies, we will focus on the following topics: origin of dopant in AOSs, mobility limitation in AOSs, etc.\"\n",

        "input": "The goal of the Space-WATCH program is to provide real-time persistent tracking of all objects in low earth orbit (LEO) so that when an anomalous action occurs, operators can be notified in a timely fashion, allowing them to plan and execute appropriate actions.To accomplish this, Space-WATCH aims to capitalize on the enormous volume of low-cost in-situ sensors in LEO on both commercial and government satellites that can contribute to continuous detection and tracking of nearby objects, identify when an anomaly or unexpected event/movement occurs, and then provide relevant details in a timely fashion to ground-based operators who can then direct appropriate action.\nCritical to this process will be the establishment of an “as-a-service” model to incentivize data collection from non-government owned sensors that can be processed to form a single operational picture of LEO.\nThe U.S. Government, specifically the Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Commerce (DoC), continue to make significant investments in addressing the Space Domain Awareness (SDA) mission. As the proliferated LEO (pLEO) commercial and defense ecosystems grow the need for understanding the environment is growing along with it.\nAt its most fundamental level SDA is required to ensure safe satellite operations and good stewardship of space, much in the same way that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) fulfills this role for air traffic. Currently sensing and tracking of space objects is conducted by the Space Surveillance Network (SSN), which primarily uses ground-based radars. Space-WATCH seeks to overcome the limitations of these ground-based sensors and add capability and capacity by moving observations from the ground to constellations of satellites throughout LEO.\nSpecifically, Space-WATCH seeks to leverage the growing number of commercial LEO constellations carrying low-cost but highly proliferated sensor technology to gain situational awareness throughout LEO at a fraction of the cost of the existing ground-based approaches. This will provide the opportunity for commercial LEO operators to capitalize on an additional revenue stream by providing on-orbit observations that will make the LEO environment safer for all participants.\n",

        "input": "US Army forces completed a firing test of the first Iron Dome missile defense battery purchased by the United States, the Defense Ministry announced on Monday.\nThe series of experiments took place at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico and saw US Army troops successfully intercept targets.\nThe tests were done in collaboration with the Israeli Defense Ministry’s Administration for the Development of Weapons and Technological Infrastructure, Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), and mPrest, producers of software technology.\nAccording to a statement released by the ministry, the Iron Dome system in its American configuration is expected “to protect deployed American forces from a variety of aerial threats, including cruise missiles, unmanned aerial vehicles, rockets and shrapnel.”\nWhile America has its THAAD anti-ballistic missile defense system designed to intercept and destroy short-, medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles in their terminal phase, it does not have any short-range air defense solutions.\nThe purchase was made to fill its short-term needs for an Indirect Fire Protection Capability, until a permanent solution to the problem is put in place to best protect ground maneuvering troops against an increasingly wide range of aerial threats, including short-range projectiles.\nThe US Army purchased the two off-the-shelf batteries from Rafael in August 2019 that were delivered in late 2020. The army has since been in the process of examining and building training systems for the batteries.\nAccording to a February report in Defense News, the US Army has been finalizing where to deploy the two batteries with Brig.-Gen. Brian Gibson, the lead on the service’s air and missile defense modernization effort.\n“That plan is being developed and finalized at the headquarters of the Department of the Army and across the enterprise on what makes sense based on all the various variables that get a vote including threat, money, transportation, time – all those things,” Gibson told Defense News in a recent interview.\n“But I’m confident from a user perspective that if directed to do so, we’re on a timeline and on a path to make it absolutely feasible to deploy this thing, and that remains our intent. Our intent is not to park them in a parking garage.”\nThe purchase of the batteries included 12 launchers, two sensors, two battlement management centers and 240 interceptors.\nThe prime contractor for the development and production of the Iron Dome is Rafael Advanced Systems. The MMR radar is developed by ELTA, a subsidiary of IAI, and the command and control system is developed by mPrest.\nThe fully mobile system carries 10 kg. of explosives, and can intercept an incoming projectile from four to 70 km. away. It is able to calculate when rockets will land in open areas – choosing not to intercept them – or toward civilian centers.\nThe army earmarked over $1 billion for the project to integrate components of the system into the US military’s Integrated Battle Command System. A 2023 deadline was imposed by Congress on the military to either develop its own system or purchase additional Iron Dome systems from Israel.\nThe world’s largest cargo plane, an Antonov AN-225, landed at Ben-Gurion Airport last year carrying US military Oshkosh trucks to be fitted with Iron Dome launchers purchased by the US Army.\nThe Iron Dome, which is designed to shoot down short-range rockets, is an integral component of Israel’s multi-layered defense array.\nThe Arrow-2 and Arrow-3 systems intercept ballistic missiles outside of the Earth’s atmosphere, while the David’s Sling missile defense system is designed to intercept tactical ballistic missiles and medium- to long-range rockets, as well as cruise missiles fired from ranges of 40 km. to 300 km.\n",

Teal’s Golden Eagle drone with Autonodyne software has already successfully demonstrated drone “swarms” and provides features like “unlimited surveillance” that seamlessly rotates multiple drones over a single point of interest for 24/7 coverage.\nUnder the terms of the license, Teal has secured exclusive right to Autonodyne’s software suite for “autonomy and exchange of control among humans and machines to perform tasks involving crewed and/or uncrewed vehicles.” Autonodyne has agreed to exclusively provide its software to Teal’s current and prospective customers for single vehicles, multi-vehicles, and linked multi-vehicles, whether existing or planned in the future, and includes Autonodyne’s patents and unpatented technology. \nRed Cat CEO Jeff Thompson said, “Teal’s products have repeatedly proven in testing that they can handle difficult mission-specific assignments with ease and offer autonomous capabilities that are superior to other drones. Autonodyne is the first of multiple development partners we plan to integrate and test with for prospective applications in the government and military segments served by our Teal division. Under the terms of the agreement, Autonodyne software will only be made available to Teal, effectively jumping Teal ahead of other drone companies seeking to provide multi-vehicle control or capabilities like unlimited surveillance. Competitors will have to develop their own software or secure licenses from others with inferior test performance.\n“Adding Autonodyne software to the Golden Eagle is as significant to our Company’s financial success as it is to our customers’ mission success. At 42%, the gross margin on the Golden Eagle is certainly good, but adding Autonodyne software to the Golden Eagle increases our gross margin to over 60%,” concluded Thompson.\nGeorge Matus, founder of Teal, said, “Red Cat has immediate potential to be a leader in this industry’s government and military segments. Golden Eagle was selected as one of only a handful of drones certified for U.S. Government procurement and it is continuously being improved, with a new version to be announced soon. Our hardware-enabled software approach allows us to meet or exceed the security and performance requirements for military operation, border control, public safety, and more. As shown by recent international events, small drones irrefutably make a major difference in front-line outcomes. With fleet level operation at just a few thousand dollars per mission versus millions for larger scale equipment, the attraction of our products is clear.”\n",

        "input": "Researchers have demonstrated a silicon-based optical communication link that combines two multiplexing technologies to create 40 optical data channels that can simultaneously move data. The new chip-scale optical interconnect can transmit about 400 GB of data per second—the equivalent of about 100,000 streaming movies. This could improve data-intensive internet applications from video streaming services to high-capacity transactions for the stock market. \n\"As demands to move more information across the internet continue to grow, we need new technologies to push data rates further,\" said Peter Delfyett, who led the University of Central Florida College of Optics and Photonics (CREOL) research team. \"Because optical interconnects can move more data than their electronic counterparts, our work could enable better and faster data processing in the data centers that form the backbone of the internet.\"\nA multi-institutional group of researchers describes the new optical communication link in Optics Letters. It achieves 40 channels by combining a frequency comb light source based on a new photonic crystal resonator developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) with an optimized mode-division multiplexer designed by the researchers at Stanford University. Each channel can be used to carry information much like different stereo channels, or frequencies, transmit different music stations.\n\"We show that these new frequency combs can be used in fully integrated optical interconnects,\" said Chinmay Shirpurkar, co-first author of the paper. \"All the photonic components were made from silicon-based material, which demonstrates the potential for making optical information handling devices from low-cost, easy-to-manufacture optical interconnects.\"\nIn addition to improving internet data transmission, the new technology could also be used to make faster optical computers that could provide the high levels of computing power needed for artificial intelligence, machine learning, large-scale emulation and other applications.\nUsing multiple light dimensions\nThe new work involved research teams led by Firooz Aflatouni of the University of Pennsylvania, Scott B. Papp from NIST, Jelena Vuckovic from Stanford University and Delfyett from CREOL. It is part of the DARPA Photonics in the Package for Extreme Scalability (PIPES) program, which aims to use light to vastly improve the digital connectivity of packaged integrated circuits using microcomb-based light sources.\nThe researchers created the optical link using tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) waveguides on a silicon substrate fabricated into a ring with a nanopatterned oscillation on the inner wall. The resulting photonic crystal micro-ring resonator turns a laser input into ten different wavelengths. They also designed and optimized a mode-division multiplexer that transforms each wavelength into four new beams that each have different shapes. Adding this spatial dimension enables a fourfold increase in data capacity, creating the 40 channels.\nOnce the data is encoded onto each beam shape and each beam color, the light is recombined back into a single beam and transmitted to its destination. At the final destination, the wavelengths and beam shapes are separated so that each channel can be received and detected independently, without interference from the other transmitted channels.\n\"An advantage of our link is that the photonic crystal resonator enables easier soliton generation and a flatter comb spectrum than those demonstrated with conventional ring resonators,\" said co-first author Jizhao Zang from NIST. \"These features are beneficial for optical data links.\"\nBetter performance with inverse design\nTo optimize the mode division multiplexer, the researchers used a computational nanophotonic design approach called photonic inverse-design. This method provides a more efficient way to explore a full range of possible designs while offering smaller footprints, better efficiencies and new functionalities.\n\"The photonic inverse-design approach makes our link highly customizable to meet the needs of specific applications,\" said co-first author Kiyoul Yang from Stanford University.\nTests of the new device matched well with simulations and showed that the channels exhibited a low crosstalk of less than -20 dB. Using less than ?10 dBm of received optical receiver power, the link performed error-free data transmission in 34 out of the 40 channels using a PRBS31 pattern, a standard used to test high-speed circuits under stress.\nThe researchers are now working to further improve the device by incorporating photonic crystal micro-ring resonators that produce more wavelengths or by using more complex beam shapes. Commercializing these devices would require the full integration of a transmitter and receiver chip with high bandwidth, low power consumption and a small footprint. This could enable the next generation of optical interconnects for use in data-center networks.\nOpen-source code for the photonic optimization software used in the paper is available on GitHub.\n",

The 40 CTAS is easily integrated into armored vehicles for either new build or system upgrades. French Army’s new Jaguar is armed with this gun.\nCTA's new unmanned turret developed with Escribano and unveiled at Eurosatory 2022 (Picture source: Army Recognition)\nThe 40 CTAS is a comprehensive modular weapon package that includes : ? The 40 CT cannon ? The Ammunition Handling System, is a carousel-type linkless magazine that can be customized in terms of shape and capacity to any turret layout. With no limit on the number of ammunition natures loaded, the AHS is capable of rapidly switching between natures to suit the threat. ? The Gun Control Equipment, is a state-of-the-art servo-motor power drive and stabilization system serving both elevation and traverse axes. ? The Gun mount is the bespoke cradle providing a plug-and-play mechanical interface between your turret and the cannon. ? The CTAS controller is an electronic full system control unit incorporating cannon and AHS management according to the highest levels of safety and reliability. Also includes an integrated Fire Control System (FCS).\nAPFSDS-T: Armour Piercing Fin Stabilised Discarding Sabot-Tracer. The tungsten projectile of the APFSDS-T can penetrate more than 140 mm of RHA (Rolled Homogenous Armour) at 1,500 m (Picture source: CTA International)\nInnovation\nThe key feature that characterizes the Cased Telescoped technology and differentiates it from conventional medium caliber cannon is that the projectile is telescoped inside the cartridge case and surrounded by propellant. Compared to a conventional cartridge the overall round volume is reduced, especially the length.\nThe reduced length of the round allows rounds to be fed into the chamber along a line perpendicular to the barrel axis; the chamber is subsequently rotated through 90°, the round is fired, the chamber rotates a further 90° and the next round is introduced, displacing and ejecting the spent case of the last round.\nThis ‘push-through’ operation results in a very compact weapon design with low turret intrusion. The principal advantage, however, is that the axis of the introduction of the rounds is coincident with the elevation axis of the weapon, therefore, allowing ammunition to be fed into the chamber along the same feed line regardless of the elevation angle of the gun. This results in the feed mechanism being completely static (with respect to the turret structure) and allows for more simple fire-on-the-move operations.\nThe feed mechanism is comprised of a carousel-style Ammunition Handling System which provides quick and easy access to specific ammunition when required.\nPerformance\nWith its compact, versatile Cased Telescoped design, the 40 CTAS enables the agility and mobility needed for critical missions, without compromising on firepower. Thanks to its compact size, the system is easily adaptable to any type of turret, either land or naval, manned or unmanned. It is compatible with small race-ring diameters. The low turret intrusion enabled by the ‘push-through’ architecture allows extremely high elevation angles up to 75°.\nThe 40 CTAS achieves a 4km+ operational range while delivering unmatched armor penetration for a medium-caliber weapon. The terminal effect of the 40mm HE round is 4 times greater than that of a 30 mm conventional High Explosive round. The 40 CTAS ammunition can address land, naval and aerial targets including emerging drone threats.\nThe 40 CTAS has a rate of fire up to 200 rounds per minute and includes a high accuracy mode compatible with a coincidence firing system.\nRapid Fire\nThe RapidFire is a self-propelled anti-aircraft gun system developed and designed by the French companies Thales, Nexter and the Anglo-French joint venture company CTA. The RapidFire 40 mm mobile, the multi-role weapon system is designed to respond to the new threats being encountered by armed forces today and in particular the low-cost targets which can attack in swarms and can saturate conventional missile defenses.\nThe Rapid Fire is available in a naval version to protect ships against aerial threats, including UAVs, a role where its outstanding high elevation angle enables remarkable defense. CTA also showcased a model of French VBCI fitted with a T40 unmanned turret armed with the CT40 gun, similar to the British Ajax, as well as French and Belgian Jaguar (CaMo) programs.

Mark Kelly said Oct. 25 that within the past six weeks the shortage of F135 engines dropped from about 48 to less than 40. This reduction comes as the Air Force has brought on more planes, making it “more than just a small improvement, it’s an exponential improvement, and I expect them to continue that trend of getting toward zero just as soon as we can,” he said.\nTo address the shortage, ACC has still been forced to “pull some levers” to ensure the engines are properly prioritized, Kelly said during a Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies event. For example, ACC cut back on its air show schedule, especially in the eastern half of the country.\n“I can’t in good conscience fly two airplanes from Hill [AFB, Utah] all the way to the East Coast and utilize a bunch of flying hours while we have young aviators … not getting their training sorties.”\nEngine shortages are impacting other aircraft in the service’s fighter fleet. Earlier this month, the Defense Department inspector general released an audit of F-15 and F-16 engines at depots and said that a shortage is expected to last through 2024.\nKelly said there is pressure on the F-15 and F-16 engine system, but the command is able to meet its demands for now.\n“I’m not surprised one bit if there is pressure on the supply system into 2024. I would frankly be surprised if there wasn’t pressure beyond 2024. But today, as I see it, we do not have impacts to our F-16-F-15 fleet,” Kelly said.\nThe biggest area ACC does feel pressure in engines is with the TF-33 powerplants used in the command’s E-3 AWACS and E-8 JSTARS, along with the B-52 bomber. These engines have not been manufactured for “many, many years,” Kelly said.\n“So to manufacture parts, or to find parts, is a 24/7 business,” Kelly said. “That engine and that supply chain consumes a lot more of my time and energy and concern.”\nFor example, Kelly pointed to the E-3’s main operating base at Tinker AFB, Oklahoma, which also houses the aircraft’s depot.\n“When my team takes an airplane from one side of Tinker to the other … before those engines cool down, our technicians are removing the engines to cannibalize them to take back over and put engines on the fleet.

        "input": "By combining scanning electron microscopy with ultrashort laser pulses, researchers in the US have shown that cubic boron arsenide has an important property that could be used to create better solar cells and photodetectors. Usama Choudhry and colleagues at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and the University of Houston used scanning ultrafast electron microscopy (SUEM) to confirm that “hot” electrons in the semiconductor material have long lifetimes – something that could be useful in a wide range of applications in electronics.\nSometimes dubbed a “wonder material”, cubic boron arsenide is a semiconductor material with several promising properties that could lead to its widespread commercial use. It is a much better conductor of heat than silicon, so it could be used to create integrated circuits that are packed together at higher densities and run at higher frequencies. The material has an electron mobility that is on par with silicon, but it has a much higher hole mobility than silicon – a property that would be useful in designing electronic devices.\nNow, Choudhry and colleagues have shown that cubic boron arsenide has another useful property: long-lived “hot” electrons. When light falls on a semiconductor it can cause the excitation of electrons with a range of energies. The lower energy electrons can persist for long enough so that they can be collected to create an electrical current – which is the basis for solar cells and light detectors. However, in most semiconductors the higher-energy hot electrons have very short lifetimes and are therefore lost before they can be collected.\nLong lived hot electrons\nCalculations done in 2017 suggested that hot electrons have relatively long lifetimes in cubic boron arsenide. However, limitations in fabricating and studying cubic boron arsenide crystals had made it difficult to confirm this prediction.\nREAD MOREAn artist's sketch of cubic boron arsenide, incorporating a ball-and-stick model of the chemical with four blue balls (representing arsenic atoms) and 14 smaller red balls (representing boron atoms). In the background is a burst of fuzzy purple-and blue lines suggesting movement of electrons\nIn their study Choudhry’s team used SUEM, which combines the temporal resolution of ultrashort laser pulses with the spatial resolution of scanning electron microscopy. The technique involves splitting the laser pulse into two parts. The first part of the pulse is used to excite hot electrons in a high-quality sample of cubic boron arsenide that was made by the Houston team. After a carefully controlled delay, the second part of the pulse is focused onto a photocathode. This generates an electron pulse that is just a few picoseconds long. This pulse is used by an electron microscope to characterize the electrons in the cubic boron arsenide.\nBy changing the delay, the team could measure the lifetime of the fast electrons in the sample, revealing that they persist for over 200 ps, which is far longer than the hot charge carriers in most semiconductors used in solar cells. The researchers say that the long lifetime suggests cubic boron arsenide could be used to make better solar cells, but much more work is needed to improve fabrication techniques.\nThe research is described in Matter.\n",

However, they have mainly been created on rigid surfaces—the Glasgow team are among the first to find a way to use gallium arsenide on a flexible substrate.\nThey adapted their existing roll printing system to print gallium arsenide electronics onto a flexible surface using arrays of wires that are 15 micrometers in width.\nThat allowed them to create a new type of flexible photodetector capable of sensing light from the ultraviolet range, through the visible portion of the spectrum, to the infrared—all of it requiring extremely low power.\nThe system is capable of ultrafast response to light, taking just 2.5 milliseconds to measure light and 8 milliseconds to recover—a performance as good as the best non-flexible photodetectors currently available.\nIn order to test the system's durability, they subjected the material to a rigorous set of tests in a machine designed to bend and twist it hundreds of times. Over the course of 500 cycles, the material demonstrated no significant loss in performance.\nProfessor Ravinder Dahiya of the University of Glasgow's James Watt School of Engineering is the leader of the Bendable Electronics and Sensing Technologies (BEST) research group, which developed the skin.\nProfessor Dahiya said: \"We've been working for a number of years now to advance the capabilities of flexible electronics. We've found new ways to print electronics directly onto flexible surfaces, built electronic skin capable of feeling 'pain,' and developed bendable electronics which can be powered by the sun or human sweat.\n\"This latest development is the first time we've been able to print gallium arsenide onto flexible surfaces, opening up new avenues for our research.\n\"In the future, this type of light-sensitive flexible material could lend new abilities to robots. Mechanical arms used for manufacturing in light-sensitive environments, for example, could become capable of detecting when conditions change and the safety or effectiveness of their work is put at risk. Flexible, broad-spectrum photodetectors could also find use in a wide range of wireless communication technologies, where the fast transmission and response speeds we've tested are always in demand.\"\nAyoub Zumeit and Abhishek Dahiya from the BEST group and co-authors of the paper, added: \"It could even be used to develop a wearable patch for humans to use to monitor exposure to UV light during sunny days, and provide a warning when users are at risk of getting sunburned.\"\n",

(Picture source Army Recognition)\nThe Polaris MRZR Alpha was on display in an all-new configuration with a full cab enclosure for the first time at AUSA. Developed for U.S. Special Operations Command and U.S. Marine Corps, the new cab enclosure is part of an Arctic Mobility kit that also has a track system. Originally designed for enhanced Arctic and tundra mobility, the interchangeable elements of the cab enclosure and track kit can be mixed and matched for mission flexibility.\nThe full cab and tracks expand the environments the MRZR Alpha can operate in and increase an already wide range of terrain for which it is well-suited. The MRZR Alpha is internally transportable via tactical air making it very expeditionary in nature, and the modularity of the Arctic Mobility Kit allows operators to do more with one asset, greatly reducing the logistics and maintenance burdens. The cab helps protect occupants from weather conditions and environmental elements. The track conversion kit replaces each wheel with a separate track assembly, maintaining the same level of maneuverability while adding another level of off-road, all-terrain capability over snow, soft soil, and mixed terrain.\nThe MRZR Alpha is Polaris' 11th military vehicle produced in 12 years. Designed on an all-new chassis, the MRZR Alpha is an entirely new breed of light tactical vehicle. Internally transportable vehicles have restrictions to size and weight, but Polaris' investment and advances in chassis, driveline, suspension, and other technologies have allowed the company to provide a new level of durability, performance, and payload in the MRZR Alpha.\nThe MRZR Alpha is a new generation of all-terrain vehicles that fulfills an evolving and expanding mission set for special operations and expeditionary forces. The vehicle is more powerful and more capable than any other family of vehicles ever developed in this class.\nMRZR Alpha’s versatility is further enhanced by expanded exportable power. Since their introduction, MRZRs have been outfitted with counter-unmanned aerial systems, direct-fire weapons, high-energy laser systems, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems, tactical aviation ground refueling system, expeditionary command and control systems, autonomy packages, litters for casualty evacuation and communication equipment.\nWith a high-performance 8-speed transmission, a max 2000 lb payload capacity, a more durable chassis and upgraded suspension, the MRZR Alpha can handle almost any terrain and mission put in its path. It can run at a maximum speed of 96km/h with a maximum cruising range of 362 km.\n",

They include pop-up spoilers, multifunctional trailing edges on flaps that can dynamically change the surface of the wing in flight, and a semi-aeroelastic hinge that controls a moving folding tip. Compatible with any propulsion system, the active control technologies will be integrated into the wing structure to improve performance and ultimately reduce emissions.\nLonger, thinner and lighter, the eXtra composite wing design takes its inspiration from nature. Just as an eagle uses its wing and longer tailing feathers to control its flight, the new active control technologies embedded in the wing enables it to adapt its shape, span and surface for increased flight efficiency.\nThe NCC is working with Airbus to design the demonstrator wing which, being longer than standard, is more flexible, and therefore more susceptible to turbulence. The NCC will look to manufacture primary components of the ‘wing box’ structure to host the new active control technologies, comprising the upper and lower skin cover, and the leading edge and trailing edge spars.\nThe design phase is expected to be complete this summer, followed by the full-scale demonstrator wing manufacturing stage, with the first flight of the demonstrator aircraft following modification of the aircraft with the new wings. The project team is adapting a Cessna Citation VII aircraft for flight tests.\nPaul Clarke, Head of Aerospace at the National Composites Centre, says: \"Composites deliver the strength and flexibility of design that the eXtra Performance Wing demands. Together with Airbus, we’re building on the NCC’s aerospace knowledge and experience, pushing advances in industrial design for composites and the use of novel manufacturing technologies in the pursuit of zero emission aircraft.

Credit: Orbex\nThe first launch of the Orbex Prime ‘eco-rocket’ from a remote launch pad in the Highlands of Scotland is expected at the end of the year or in early 2023. A full-scale prototype of Prime, billed as the world’s most environmentally-friendly rocket, was unveiled to the public for the first time this month.\nOrbex Prime, a joint venture between the UK and Denmark, is the first of a new generation of European launch vehicles designed to launch mircosatellites to orbit.\nUnveiling a full-size replica May 11 represented a major step forward for the British rocket company as it prepares for the first ever vertical rocket launch to orbit from UK soil.\nA spokesperson told Spaceflitght Now that the company was “shooting for the end of 2022 or the start of 2023″. \nHe said: “There are three aspects which determine when the first launch can take place: readiness of the rocket, availability of a completed spaceport, and a launch license from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). \n“All three are tracking well, but Orbex are only completely in control of the readiness of the rocket. So, it is really guesswork at this point.”\nPrime is the first ‘micro-launcher’ developed in Europe to reach a stage of technical readiness and Orbex has now begun a series of dress rehearsals to develop and optimize launch procedures. To support this, it expects to announce an increase in staff shortly.\nEarlier this year, Orbex revealed its first test launch platform at a new test facility in Kinloss, a few miles from the company’s headquarters at Forres in Moray, Scotland. \nPrime is a 19-meter-long (62-foot), two-stage rocket that is powered by seven engines. The six on the first stage will propel the vehicle through the atmosphere to an altitude of around 80 kilometers (50 miles). A single, second-stage engine will complete the journey to low Earth orbit (LEO).\nUniquely, Orbex Prime is powered by a renewable bio-fuel/bio-propane supplied by Calor UK. The fuel significantly reduces the rocket’ss emissions compared to other similarly-sized rockets being developed elsewhere.\nA study by the U’s’s University of Exeter showed that a single launch of Orbex Prime will produce 96% lower carbon emissions than comparable space launch systems using fossil fuels.\nPrime is also reusable and has been engineered to leave zero debris on Earth and in orbit. It will be used commercially to launch groups of small microsatellites or slightly larger individual satellites.\nA full-scale prototype of Orbex’s prime launch vehicle. Credit: Orbex\nJosef Aschbacher, European Space Agency (ESA) director general, said: “I am deeply impressed with the speed at which the Orbex Prime rocket has been developed as the first full orbital micro-launcher in Europe. But I am equally impressed by the low-carbon footprint technology applied.”\nOrbex Prime plans to launch from Space Hub Sutherland, a new spaceport being constructed on the North Coast of Scotland. It was the first vertical spaceport to receive planning permission in the UK and will be brought into operation as a European spaceport later this year.\nIt is also the first and only spaceport worldwide that has committed to being carbon-neutral, both in its construction and operation.\nChris Larmour, CEO of Orbex, said: “Unveiling the full-scale prototype was a major milestone for Orbex and highlights just how far along our development path we now are.\n“From the outside, it might look like an ordinary rocket but on the inside Prime is unlike anything else. To deliver the performance and environmental sustainability we wanted from a 21st century rocket, we had to innovate in a wide number of areas — low-carbon fuels, fully 3D-printed rocket engines, very lightweight fuel tanks and novel, low-mass reusability technology.”\n",

That transaction is expected to close by the end of March.\nUbaryon's technology grew from the 2015 observation of an anomaly in uranium isotope separation during environmental testing. The company subsequently applied for a patent, and the intellectual property has been classified by the Australian Safeguards and Non-Proliferation Office (ASNO) since 2018.\nAccording to Okapi, Ubaryon's technology eliminates the need for conversion from yellowcake to UF6 and for deconversion from UF6 to uranium oxide, simplifying the nuclear fuel cycle and allowing for additional supply chain flexibility. Ubaryon is permitted by ASNO to possess nuclear material, and the technology has been tested and validated over a significant number of experimental runs with tests carried out on uranium feedstock and product. A \"statistically significant enrichment factor\" has been observed, between 10 and 30 times higher than that of previous chemical enrichment technologies developed in France and Japan.\nUbaryon is now working at a laboratory at Lucas Heights in Sydney to accelerate development of the technology, initially focusing on the validation of the isotope separation mechanism and extension of its enrichment factor, Okapi said.

If all goes as planned the service could field the new weapon prototype, paired with Standard Missile-6 (SM-6) and Tomahawk missiles, to soldiers by late September 2023, according to the company and service.\nThe army's Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office (RCCTO) tasked Lockheed Martin with building this mid-range prototype in late 2020, at present called the ‘Typhon', which includes launchers, missiles, and a battery operations centre.\nThe idea was to create a capability to strike targets somewhere between the 500 and 1,800 km range, or greater than the future Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) but shorter than a Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW) system. To do this, army programme officials joined forces with the navy to leverage existing capabilities such as the Mark 41 Vertical Launching System (Mk 41 VLS), and the Tomahawk and SM-6 missiles.\n“We don't have to be the bastion of every good idea; We can actually get good ideas from other people, and we can leverage those good ideas,” RCCTO Director Lieutenant General Neil Thurgood told an audience on 10 August during the Space and Missile Defense Symposium.\nJoe DePietro, Lockheed Martin's vice-president of naval combat and missile defence systems, told Janes during a 9 August interview that this effort is more of an “engineering and integration” initiative than a major development one.\nFor the army, this meant creating a containerised version of Mk 41 VLS that can be integrated and fired from the bed of a M983A4 Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT).\n“We took proven things … how we raise a panel on a flatbed to be a radar,” DePietro said. “We were able to leverage existing things that we're doing across a multitude of platforms from a radar on a truck to the Mk 41 VLS.”\n“In the case of this configuration, it is mobile [and] transportable via air,” he added.\nOnce the MRC battery is flown to a location, it is then “hooked up” to a HEMTT and soldiers are able to fire a missile in an “extremely short time period, less time than it takes to spin up the missile”, DePietro said.\n“It has a full automation suite using our machinery, control, and automation, that we use across the surface navy that was adapted to be able to do all the automation and control of the [MRC] launcher,” DePietro said. “It's very simple that someone who is not with the launcher can actually control and put it into position.”\nMore specifically, each MRC battery includes four HEMTTs each with a launcher container, a separate HEMTT used as the battery operation centre, one support vehicle for the battery operation centre, a reload trailer, and a vehicle carrying additional missiles, according to a slide Lt Gen Thurgood presented.\nFor HEMTT vehicles outfitted with launchers, when not in use, the canister is secured in a horizontal position to the back of the HEMTT bed. When soldiers decide to use the weapon system, the radar panel moves into a vertical position between the HEMTT cab and the launcher unit. This launcher unit is also now in a vertical position with four cells, each one able to hold one missile, pointing towards the sky, according to DePietro and Lt Gen Thurgood's presentation slides.\nAnother HEMTT vehicle is also used to house the battery operation centre and it includes the AEGIS Weapon System, elements of the Tomahawk Weapon System, and the army's Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS); and each one can operate up to 16 launchers, DePietro said.\nComment\nArmy soldiers are training on how to operate the MRC weapon system. Although the service has not yet received an MRC battery, Lt Gen Thurgood said the service has sent soldiers to the navy's schoolhouses to learn how to operate the AEGIS and Tomahawk.\n",

JARVIS is being designed to combine human users’ deep expertise and design intuition with a machine’s ability to explore and characterize vast search spaces to discover novel solutions to cyber-physical systems design problems.\nCyber-physical systems design is extremely complex, involving dozes of domains, and requiring subject matter expertise from designers and engineers across many disciplines. JARVIS has the potential to allow humans and machines to work collaboratively, mitigating the potential biases of human designers, while still incorporating human insights and creativity into the design process. Part of this vision is that designers will also be able to review and direct the activity of AI co-designers throughout the systems engineering lifecycle, providing critique and guiding design outcomes.\nJARVIS is being developed under the Symbiotic Design for Cyber Physical Systems (SDCPS) program. The goal of SDCPS is to enhance innovation in design through AI-based approaches that dramatically reduce the time from system inception to deployment (from years to months). The team plans for JARVIS to provide the bridge between that AI tech and human experts, and enable engineering teams to create highly performant military-relevant cyber-physical systems on unprecedented timelines.\n“What’s interesting about JARVIS and the SDCPS program is that we’re not just using AI to exhaustively explore a design space; we’re also creating tools that help engineering teams discover and understand promising—but possibly very unconventional—AI design outcomes, injecting their own unique expertise to seed and refine these designs as part of a collaborative human-machine process,” said Dr. Ryan Kilgore, Director of Human-Centered Intelligence Systems and Principal Investigator on the JARVIS effort.\nSource: Charles River Analytics\nIf you enjoyed this article, please considerbecoming a paid subscriber.

        "input": "Researchers from the University of Cambridge have used a suite of correlative, multimodal microscopy methods to visualize, for the first time, why perovskite materials are seemingly so tolerant of defects in their structure. Their findings were published today in Nature Nanotechnology.\nThe most commonly used material for producing solar panels is crystalline silicon, but to achieve efficient energy conversion requires an energy-intensive and time-consuming production process to create the highly ordered wafer structure required.\nIn the last decade, perovskite materials have emerged as promising alternatives.\nThe lead salts used to make them are much more abundant and cheaper to produce than crystalline silicon, and they can be prepared in a liquid ink that is simply printed to produce a film of the material. They also show great potential for other optoelectronic applications, such as energy efficient light emitting diodes (LEDs) and X-ray detectors.\nThe impressive performance of perovskites is surprising. The typical model for an excellent semiconductor is a very ordered structure, but the array of different chemical elements combined in perovskites creates a much 'messier' landscape.\nThis heterogeneity causes defects in the material that lead to nanoscale 'traps', which reduce the photovoltaic performance of the devices. But despite the presence of these defects, perovskite materials still show efficiency levels comparable to their silicon alternatives.\nIn fact, earlier research by the group has shown the disordered structure can actually increase the performance of perovskite optoelectronics, and their latest work seeks to explain why.\nCombining a series of new microscopy techniques, the group present a complete picture of the nanoscale chemical, structural and optoelectronic landscape of these materials, that reveals the complex interactions between these competing factors and ultimately, shows which comes out on top.\n\"What we see is that we have two forms of disorder happening in parallel,\" explains Ph.D. student Kyle Frohna, \"the electronic disorder associated with the defects that reduce performance, and then the spatial chemical disorder that seems to improve it.\n\"And what we've found is that the chemical disorder—the 'good' disorder in this case—mitigates the 'bad' disorder from the defects by funneling the charge carriers away from these traps that they might otherwise get caught in.\"\nIn collaboration with Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory, the Diamond Light Source synchrotron facility in Didcot and the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology in Japan, the researchers used several different microscopic techniques to look at the same regions in the perovskite film. They could then compare the results from all these methods to present the full picture of what's happening at a nanoscale level in these promising new materials.\n\"The idea is we do something called multimodal microscopy, which is a very fancy way of saying that we look at the same area of the sample with multiple different microscopes and basically try to correlate properties that we pull out of one with the properties we pull out of another one,\" says Frohna. \"These experiments are time consuming and resource intensive, but the rewards you get in terms of the information you can pull out are excellent.\"\nThe findings will allow the group and others in the field to further refine how perovskite solar cells are made in order to maximize efficiency.\n\"For a long time, people have thrown the term defect tolerance around, but this is the first time that anyone has properly visualized it to get a handle on what it actually means to be defect tolerant in these materials.\n\"Knowing that these two competing disorders are playing off each other, we can think about how we effectively modulate one to mitigate the effects of the other in the most beneficial way.\"\n\"In terms of the novelty of the experimental approach, we have followed a correlative multimodal microscopy strategy, but not only that, each standalone technique is cutting edge by itself,\" says Miguel Anaya, Royal Academy of Engineering Research Fellow at Cambridge's Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology\n\"We have visualized and given reasons why we can call these materials defect tolerant. This methodology enables new routes to optimize them at the nanoscale to, ultimately, perform better for a targeted application. Now, we can look at other types of perovskites that are not only good for solar cells but also for LEDs or detectors and understand their working principles.\n\"Even more importantly, the set of acquisition tools that we have developed in this work can be extended to study any other optoelectronic material, something that may be of great interest to the broader materials science community.\"\n\"Through these visualizations, we now much better understand the nanoscale landscape in these fascinating semiconductors—the good, the bad and the ugly,\" says Sam Stranks, University Assistant Professor in Energy at Cambridge's Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology.\n\"These results explain how the empirical optimisation of these materials by the field has driven these mixed composition perovskites to such high performances. But it has also revealed blueprints for design of new semiconductors that may have similar attributes—where disorder can be exploited to tailor performance.\"\n",

Developed by Leah Spangler, Michael Hecht and colleagues at Princeton University, the technique could lead to more sustainable methods for manufacturing quantum dots on industrial scales.\nQuantum dots are nanocrystals of semiconductor materials that have useful quantum properties that fall between those of bulk materials and individual atoms. With exciting applications including solar cells, LED displays and quantum technologies, research into quantum dots is a hot topic. However, the manufacture of these tiny semiconductor structures often requires both high temperatures and toxic solvents – so researchers are on the look-out for ways of making quantum dots that are more environmentally friendly.\nIn the study, the team investigated how quantum dots could be made using finely tuned biochemical reactions that involve a protein that does not exist naturally in biological systems. Instead, the protein was made in the lab by combining naturally-occurring amino acids.\nMaking metals safe\nThat protein is called Construct K (ConK) and it was first synthesized in 2016. Previous work has shown that ConK allows E Coli bacteria to survive toxic concentrations of copper. Although the chemical mechanisms that boost bacterial survival are not fully understood, scientists suspect that it involves catalysis processes that cause metal atoms to bind to molecules – rendering the atoms less toxic. In nature, a similar process is achieved by natural proteins found in some types of bacteria that can live in high concentrations of metals.\nQuantum dots are often made from compound semiconductors such as cadmium sulphide – which includes the toxic metal cadmium. As a result, Hecht and colleagues predicted that ConK could be used in the synthesis of cadmium sulphide quantum dots. The team found that ConK was able to catalyse the breakdown of the amino acid cysteine, creating by-products including hydrogen sulphide. This compound can then react with cadmium to create the cadmium sulphide nanocrystals.\nWhen compared to natural proteins, Hecht’s team found that its new approach has two key advantages that are related to the slower growth of the nanocrystals when created using ConK. One advantage is that the cadmium sulphide nanocrystals are created mostly with the same crystal structure, rather than with a mixture of two different crystal structures. The second is that the nanocrystals stabilize at sizes of roughly 3 nm, albeit in slightly irregular shapes.\n“The quantum dots we’re making aren’t great quality yet, but that can be improved by tuning the synthesis,” says Spangler. “We can achieve better quality by engineering the protein to influence quantum dot formation in different ways.”\nIn the future, they hope this technique could lead to the industrial-scale manufacture of stable, high-quality quantum dots at room temperature – ensuring a more sustainable future for the rapidly-growing quantum dot industry.\nThe research is described in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n",

The President’s Budget reflects the strongest economic growth in nearly 40 years and has put the deficit on track for the largest-ever one-year decline of $1.3 trillion. The FY 2023 Budget will strengthen the nation’s economic security while lowering costs for families and investing in a more diverse and inclusive workforce that mirrors the priorities of the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The Department of Energy’s (DOE) budget includes investments to fight climate change through the accelerated deployment of clean energy, restructure our energy portfolio to strengthen our energy independence, and invest in urban and rural communities that have been disproportionately impacted by climate change but overlooked in the clean energy transition.\n“After a year of unprecedented economic growth that resulted in over $500 billion in deficit reduction, the President’s Budget reflects his commitment to protecting our national security, cleaning up legacy pollution from historic nuclear activities, and transitioning the U.S. to clean energy,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “As we facilitate the transition to clean energy, the investments reflected in this latest budget will cut costs for Americans and secure our energy independence on our path towards a net-zero future.”\nIn total, DOE’s FY 2023 Budget Request is $48.2 billion, and makes critical investments in the American people that will help lay a stronger foundation for shared growth and prosperity for generations to come, including:\n? Increasing energy affordability and resilience. The Budget invests $502 million to weatherize at least 50,000 homes through the Weatherization Assistance Program, including, $100 million for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) Advantage pilot to retrofit and decarbonize low-income households through installation of energy efficient electric appliances and systems that reduce will energy bills. Another $105 million will be used for Energy Future Grants that will help states create more reliable and affordable clean energy systems.\n? Supporting secure supply chains to be resilient to geopolitical disruptions. The Budget invests $200 million to bolster the U.S. supply chain for solar energy technologies through a new Solar Manufacturing Accelerator. DOE’s National Laboratories will partner with other nations with $18 million to develop robust decarbonization pathways and plans and foster collaboration between the United States and partnered nations to bolster secure supply chains and expand economic opportunities. Through this proposed budget, DOE’s Loan Programs Office would receive $5 billion in new lending authority, which includes additional support for domestic critical mineral supply chains.

        "input": "The reforms are aligned with legislation enacted earlier this year to develop the national defence industrial base and to encourage greater emphasis within the country on military technology innovation.\nThe MND said on 28 July that the reforms will encompass new defence strategies, including a proposed ‘Defence Vision 2050' policy, new methods to develop and procure innovative military technologies, and the reorganisation of a series of MND-affiliated agencies and divisions.\nThe plans – collectively dubbed by the MND as its “Future defence innovation initiative” – were announced during a meeting in Seoul chaired by South Korean Minister of National Defense Suh Wook.\nIn comments published by the MND, Suh said, “As neighbouring countries are devoting national capabilities towards developing science and technologies to prepare for the future, our military must also rapidly apply advanced science and technology and focus on developing defence policies and strategies for the future.”\nHe added, “The future defence innovation initiative is not a one-time, short-term task but a critical issue for the future of national defence. We will continue to push this forward.” Suh said the initiative will focus on several areas of planning including defence policy, acquisition processes, technologies, military interoperability, and the reform of defence-support agencies.\nIn terms of defence policy, the MND said it intends to publish later this year its ‘Defence Vision 2050', which will outline long-term science and technology requirements. Linked to this vision will be a new policy, said the MND, similar to the US government's National Defense Strategy, which will provide a road map for strategic challenges and MND responses.\nTo respond to fast-moving developments in science and technology, the MND also pledged to reform procurement processes – including planning and management – to enable the accelerated acquisition of modern technologies. To support this effort, the MND and its procurement agency, the Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA), launched a pilot ‘rapid acquisition project' in 2020.\nPolicy and procurement processes will be geared towards supporting the RoK Armed Forces' operation of advanced military technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), unmanned combat systems, and “electronic warfare systems for the new battlefield”, said the MND. Plans for the integration of these capabilities will be drawn up by the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), it added.\nThe MND said that the JCS will integrate such capabilities through a new concept of ‘future joint operations' that will incorporate “intelligence-based operations, cyberspace, and manned and unmanned systems”.\nFurther support for the initiative will be provided by reforms within the MND. “We will pursue a proactive reorganisation of the MND, which will lead the future national defence strategy,” it said.\nThese reforms will occur in stages, it said, and will include the establishment of a new defence\nscience and technology committee, which will shape defence research and development activities; and a reorganisation of the MND's divisions for reform and policy to put greater emphasis on the development and procurement of new technologies.\nThe initiatives outlined by the MND are aligned with the Act on Defense Industry Development and Support that was introduced in February 2021 and the Defense Science and Technology Innovation Promotion Act, which was enacted in April. The aim of these laws is to maximise local industry's involvement in developing technologies and equipment for the RoK Armed Forces.\nThe MND has stated that, supported by the new laws, it is aiming to source about 80% of military requirements under this plan from local industry. Janes analysis suggests that local sourcing in recent years has been about 65%.\n",

        "input": "October 15, 2021War on the Rocks By: Chris Bassler and Ben Noon Related Expert:Chris Bassler\nXi Jinping wants China to have a “world-class military” by the middle of the century. While the country has undergone a historic military modernization effort in the last two decades, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) remains a regional military power, albeit one with growing ambitions to achieve regional dominance and expand its ability to project power around the globe.\nIs Xi’s dream of a world-class PLA realistic? His vision largely depends on PLA efforts to increase jointness and achieveintelligentization.\nBy all accounts, the Chinese military is on the march. The PLA’s annual budgetgrowsat a rapid pace year after year. The PLA Navy is nowlargerthan the U.S. Navy. “Carrier-killer” missiles attempt tothreatenAmerica’s ability to project power in the Indo-Pacific. The PLA’s increasingly sophisticated nuclear arsenalgrowsat an alarming pace. But these raw numbers alone do not capture some of the more subtle measures of warfighting capabilities, such as organization, training, education, and doctrinal concepts. These seldom noted yet critical measures of military power may tell a different story about the PLA’s pace of growth and ability to achieve its ambitions.\nA close look at some aspects of military modernization progress that are harder to measure shows that the PLA still faces some significant, but not insurmountable, issues in catching up with the U.S. military. Specifically, the PLA’s ongoing struggles to embrace jointness among the service branches, as well as the challenge of updating doctrine to reflect the implications of their belief in a military revolution through artificial intelligence, reveal nuances that are crucial for a broader understanding of the Chinese military. Despite its continued growth, the extent to which the PLA can handle the less tangible side of military modernization will be vital for the Chinese military’s future warfighting capabilities.\nThe PLA’s apparently growing prowess coupled with persistent challenges leaves a Chinese military akin to Schrodinger’s cat. In the famous physics thought experiment, a hypothetical cat located inside a box with poison may be considered simultaneously both alive and dead until confirmed by observation, made when opening the box. The rapidly-expanding PLA remains untested on the modern battlefield, leaving both internal and external observers uncertain about China’s true warfighting capabilities. This dilemma means that analysts should carefully watch for any signs of progress in the Chinese military’s continued development, beginning with the PLA’s commentary about itself.\nOngoing Difficulties with Jointness\nSince his ascent to the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the PLA, some of Xi’s primary governing priorities have been to complete the PLA’s modernization by 2035 and become a “world-class military” by 2049. Jointness is at the core of these efforts. “Jointness” refers to the process ofintegratingeach of the military services together into a cohesive whole with the sum greater than its parts. Effective joint operations allow the service branches to emphasize their strengths and mitigate their weaknesses. Promoting jointness, however, requires cultivating a joint culture, breaking through parochial service interests, and coordinating disparate operational efforts, among other challenges.\nBeginning in 2015, Xi unveiled sweeping military reforms that sought to prepare the PLA institutionally for a joint future. These reforms includedcreatinga new command-and-control structure,replacingregional commands with a theater command system,shrinkingthe size and influence of the army,establishingthe Strategic Support Force, and enhancing cadre training and education, and other efforts. These changes have been well-documented and are a crucial foundation for the PLA’s fighting abilities.\nHowever, Chinese strategists believe that the PLA is having a difficult time integrating jointness into the force despite continued efforts. For the past five years, Chinese commentators have written in academic journals, news sources, and popular media about Xi’s efforts to make the PLA into a truly joint force, and they conclude that China still has a long way to go to achieve its ambitions. They complain about interservice rivalry, technological issues, and ineffective operational commanders.\nChinese authors write consistently that the PLA’s services are at each other’s throats. This diagnosis is captured with pithy phraseslike“mountain-stronghold mentality [山头主义]” or “each fights the others [各自为战].” These complaints point to the ongoing importance and difficulty for the PLA of shrinking the size and influence of the ground forces, especially since the army isnotoriouslyparochial and views itself as the preeminent branch. Chinese strategists know how daunting it will be to encourage the services to get along.\nAdditionally, Chinese authors see ongoing technical challenges in advancing a joint force. One of the most important steps to ensure the services can work together is guaranteeing that technologies among the services are compatible, resulting in improved interoperability. Chinese strategistswritethat the PLA needs a “unified information technology system standard” to achieve its jointness goals.\nLastly, Chinese commentators believe that mid-level operational commanders arenotproperly equipped for modern warfare. This worry is captured by the phrase, “Five Incapables [五个不会].” This official Chinese slogandeclaresthat officer cadres cannot correctly judge battle situations, do not understand central leadership intentions, are unable to make operational decisions, cannot deploy troops, and are unable to deal with emergencies. Xi himself has emphasized this theme, and he believes this problem is of paramount importance for the PLA to overcome. In fact, it has been the most frequentlyusedslogan in the PLA since 2015. This shows the extent to which diagnoses of PLA limitations predominantly come from the political leadership instead of from the military itself.\nThese concerns about the PLA reflect real issues. There are many observable symptoms of the PLA’s jointness challenges that confirm party leadership suspicions. For example, one of the PLA’s foremost military institutions, the National Defense University, recently launched a Joint Operations Academy that appears to be undergoing a kind of curriculum revolution. The academy is meant to be on the cutting edge of training cadres for joint warfighting. In practice, this means that it is undergoing immense change at a rapid pace. The curriculum haschangedconstantly since its founding in 2017. This pace of change has irritated students and teachers alike, with professorscomplainingthat they no longer know what to teach their military students about joint warfare. If the National Defense University is having a difficult time training its students for jointness, then the other military universities and training commands likely face similar problems.\nAnother example comes in the promulgation of new jointness doctrine. In November 2020, the PLAunveiledwhat it called an “outline” for joint operational guidelines, regulation, and doctrine moving forward. While the document is not public, the government has made clear that the outline is meant to establish basic rules and guidelines for joint warfighting. The outline is a sign that the PLA continues to take jointness reforms seriously, although they remain only in the preliminary stages of implementation. Most of the PLA’s officers have limited actual experience with conducting joint operations. It will be years until most PLA soldiers are intimately familiar with the other service branches and can determine how to work well together.\nA Chinese military that diagnoses and confronts its own clear flaws may well be able to summon the necessary efforts to enact the difficult changes it needs to achieve jointness. Thus far, the PLA appears to have messaged that it is advancing necessary reforms. Much will depend on its ability to continue the pace and depth of reforms, even as it attempts to increase use of AI for future warfare.\nVisions of a Military Revolution via AI: A Risky Approach\nAs Chinese officials, military strategists, and analysts admit, the PLA has a long way to go to become a joint force, but not for lack of effort. Many Chinese strategists are looking toward the future for new operational concepts and theories to help the army accelerate its efforts to become a world-class military. At the center of these public discussions is a new and little-understood concept called “intelligentization (智能化),” which represents a new goal for the PLA’s progress in modernization.\nChinese discussion ofintelligentizationreveals the seemingly boundless hopes that Chinese analysts have for the potential of futuristic technology. They call for the integration of AI to give superior decision-making capabilities to the operational commander, and for enlightened autonomous weapons systems to replace humans on the battlefield. The PLA believes not only intelligentization could provide the solution to its difficulties with jointness, but also that it will fundamentally change future warfare and provide a rareopportunityto leapfrog its development over that of Beijing’s adversaries. However, hidden behind Chinese analysts’ hopes to achieve their own revolution in military affairs are multiple potential and real challenges that could complicate Chinese technologically based military dominance.\nFirst, Chinese theorists’ discussions about intelligentization overwhelmingly call for highly centralized decision-making structures. These strategists want operational commanders advised by advanced algorithms to perfectly direct intelligent swarms of autonomous battle systems to achieve campaign objectives. Chinese theorists believe this approach will consolidate command responsibility onto a few generals who can remain safely away from the frontlines of the battlefield, which is antithetical to the modern concept ofmission command. In this situation, though, the failure of any operational commander could be crippling in a wartime scenario, and Chinese theorists do not appear to recognize this risk — at least compared to the perceived gains.\nSecond, theorists of intelligentization seem to miss the inherent fragility that remains in AI and autonomous systems. The future PLA that Chinese strategists describe is based almost entirely on advanced technology, with little discussion about potential risks and mitigation approaches. If these ambitions are realized, a well-placed electronic warfare attack from an adversary could severely hamper the PLA’s command of its forces.\nLastly, Chinese strategists discussing intelligentization appear to have too much faith in the capabilities of AI and advanced technologies. These writersarguethat autonomous systems will eventually be better at making decisions than humans. They go so far as to claim that future warfare will come to closely resemble depictions from theStar Warsmovies.\nAlthough advancements continue, many non-technologists continue to overestimate the ability of AI to make decisions. While AI hype may be starting towaneamidst the recognition that AI is “neither artificial nor intelligent,” the PLA does not yet seem to have acknowledged or digested this skepticism. Future Chinese autonomous systems will inevitably reflect the designers’ biases of what a war would look like, as well as the training data used to develop underlying rulesets. In the chaos of combat operations in future warfare, autonomous systems will face unexpected challenges that will not be fully accounted for by the AI’s designers, and that can only be properly addressed through human ingenuity. As intelligentization efforts proceed and more command decisions can be delegated to machines, the PLA will also need to enhance the technical proficiency of its officer and enlisted corps to continue developing and applying AI to warfare. Paradoxically, this could result in a greater split among the PLA’s manpower, with corps members underqualified for the technical aspects and underutilized because of automated decision-making.\nPLA overconfidence in the potential of futuristic technology carries various risks that could weigh on the its warfighting capabilities. Whereas popular discussion within China heralds the PLA’s technological capabilities and advancements as a game-changing shift in future warfare, these new technologies are only as useful as they are manifested and effectively applied in Chinese warfighting doctrine. It is important for outside observers to understand that intelligentization may not deliver all the advantages the PLA hopes for.\nAn Uncertain Future\nSo, ultimately, which is it? Is the PLA on the verge of regional (and eventually global) dominance based on advancing military effectiveness? Or is it still struggling to advance its most basic jointness goals and overplaying its reliance on technology? The answer is uncertain. Observing and measuring the progress of development for any military is a difficult proposition, but it is substantially more challenging due to the opacity of China’s Leninist one-party system. Understanding the future warfighting ability of the PLA requires parsing the often inconsistent, contradictory, and confusing environment that China offers to outside observers. These challenges are further multiplied by the fact that the Chinese army has no real-world options to truly test its advancing capabilities while still ensuring necessary battlefield successes.\nIt is nonetheless clear that the PLA still lags in a couple of key metrics of warfighting capabilities. Its attempts to integrate jointness into the force are still nascent and largely without tangible successes to help accelerate further change. Chinese military theorists’ visions of intelligentization appear to overestimate the transformative potential of AI and could set the army up for failure in the long-term. Both jointness and intelligentization will be an albatross on the PLA as its responsibilities and mission sets widen to reflect the communist party’s rapidly expanding global ambitions.\nThe persistent challenges and ambiguities in China’s military development illustrate the importance of understanding the oftentimes underrated, and more difficult to measure, aspects of military power. The PLA’s ability to manage these contradictions will be crucial as it continues its modernization efforts to achieve its future warfighting ambitions. Western analysts should closely watch the subtle measures of military power to see past the often-simplistic headlines of the PLA’s modernization.\nThe PLA needs to attempt intelligentization to mitigate some of its own shortcomings, particularly for command and control, and to compete with other efforts underway by its rivals, principally the United States. Even if successful, however, achieving intelligentization will open the PLA to an entirely new set of vulnerabilities that may reduce any effective advantage attained. Although the PLA will continue to demonstrate some limited combined arms operations, holistic jointness is likely to remain a mirage for the foreseeable future due to the services’ deep-seated cultures and rivalries.\nEven if the PLA can overcome its internal challenges, success in war will remain uncertain. Ultimately, victory on the battlefield depends on where the battle is fought and against whom. China is increasingly becoming a formidable military adversary in the Western Pacific. Although the possibility of the PLA becoming “world class” by Xi’s own criteria seems unlikely, the U.S. military and key allies will have their hands full in a contingency inside the first and second island chains of the Indo-Pacific. Perhaps only opening Schrodinger’s box, with real combat experience, will reveal the PLA’s actual progress in achieving its modernization goals.\n",

        "input": "Seawater, which comprises more than 95% of the Earth's water, could become a key resource in the sustainable production of clean hydrogen fuel with use of water-splitting catalysts developed by a KAUST-led team.\nWater splitting could offer an appealing way to carbon neutrality, especially when coupled with renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. Water splitting involves the breakdown of water in an electrochemical cell to produce hydrogen at the cathode while generating oxygen at the anode under applied voltage. Yet, hydrogen and oxygen evolution catalysts that perform well in fresh water become less effective in seawater because of abundant ions that can promote unwanted reactions and poison catalysts.\nHighly corrosive chloride ions present in seawater undergo complex reactions that compete with oxygen evolution and generate harmful compounds, such as hypochlorite. Because hydrogen production hinges on stable and efficient reactions at both electrodes, these ions are a major challenge for seawater splitting.\nChemist Huabin Zhang explains that hypochlorite formation can occur because it demands a lower operational voltage to meet industrial needs than the oxygen evolution reaction.\nOne way to tackle this issue is to design selective anode catalysts with lower voltage requirements. A nickel–iridium monolayered anode catalyst showed enhanced performance and stability in seawater thanks to synergistic effects between its metal components.\nZhang's team devised an approach that provides high-efficiency and stable hydrogen evolution electrocatalysts for seawater splitting. The researchers created tiny cubic reactors, in which the catalyst was encased in a molybdenum sulfide protective shell. The catalyst core consisted of a carbon-supported molybdenum-based redox active compound and featured a zeolite-like ordered nanoporous structure.\nUsing a metal organic framework-based approach, the researchers combined metal complex precursors with the linker imidazole in the presence of surfactant to generate zeolite-like zinc–molybdenum cubes. They mixed the resulting structures with thioacetamide in ethanol under reflux to form a cubic molybdenum oxide phase confined in a thin zinc sulfide shell.\nNext, they chemically converted the cubic phase into the desired molybdenum sulfide-encapsulated redox active compound at high temperature before selectively etching the zinc sulfide outer layer to yield the nanoreactors.\nThe nanoreactors exhibited high electrocatalytic activity and stability in both fresh water and seawater. \"The remarkable activity and stability are attributed to their unique structure,\" Zhang says.\nThe core displayed numerous active sites that boosted hydrogen production and the shell presented several defects within its layers, especially subnanometer-sized holes that allowed water molecules to permeate and access the internal active sites.\nActing as a chainmail, the shell also blocked and prevented salts from depositing on the active sites.\nThe hierarchical architecture of the nanoreactor isolates the electrolysis from side reactions. \"Similar to a smart house, the main reaction occurs in the rooms while side reactions happen in the backyard,\" Zhang says.\nTheir findings are published in Chem Catalysis.\nThe researchers are now designing advanced catalysts with specific configuration to achieve a more sustainable energy conversion during seawater splitting. They are also investigating the structural evolution and behavior of the reactive centers during the catalytic process to gain in-depth knowledge of the seawater splitting technique for future advancement and mass commercialization.\n",

Aircraft could vary in gross weight from 4,000 lbs. to over 100,000 lbs.\nPrior to its public unveiling in 2021 following the AFWerx announcement, the HVSTOL concept was “something that the company had been working on as a proprietary project,” says Jason Hurst, vice president of Bell’s Innovation unit. “We’re looking for something that can hover in a crosswind; hover for an extended period and still fly over 400 knots. There’s a natural barrier in physics you run into with a helicopter for [higher] flight speeds and it’s the same thing with tilt rotors. So, we’re looking towards what’s next beyond that.”\nIn the stop/fold tiltrotor concept, the rotors are configured vertically for takeoff and landing, and then tilt down for transition to horizontal flight. As the vehicle accelerates, the rotors are feathered, allowing them to stop through aerodynamic braking. The blades then fold back along the wingtip nacelles and a conventional turbofan engine provides thrust at cruise speeds exceeding 400 kt.\nTargeting future capabilities beyond the U.S. Army’s broad-ranging Future Vertical Lift program, Bell envisages proving the baseline viability of the concept with a potential five-year research effort aimed at reaching a technology readiness level of six. The plan includes a subscale demonstrator that Hurst says is notionally a 5,000-lb. vehicle incorporating two off-the-shelf powerplants—a business jet engine for cruise and a turboshaft for vertical flight.\n“We’re going to start that at a smaller scale. What we’ve proposed today is a split engine architecture with a separate engine for hover and a separate engine for cruise,” Hurst says. “Once we prove the challenge of converting the rotors in flight, then we’ll be able to move into the larger scales with more mature technology. Ultimately we’re trying to show the art of the possible and the different types of configurations and missions that you could do with this type of vehicle.”\n“These are still in the conceptual design phase to some extent, so obviously they will evolve and change a lot as we learn more about the technology and when we get more feedback from the military base on what their needs are for special forces for expeditionary work and for logistics moving. It could be for things like that when they have to move in a contested environment when no runways are available,” he adds.\nWhile Bell’s HSVTOL still relies on the original aerodynamic data from tests of the concept five decades ago, the refreshed design will incorporate significant advances made since the 1970s in digital flight control systems, propulsion and other areas. “The thing that we’ve got to be able to solve is making a reliable rotor folding mechanism. The ones back then were just designed for test purposes,” Hurst says. “We’ve also got to do work on the flight control system to control the vehicle stability as you go through those transition phases. You are going from flying in a turboprop mode to hitting the button nobody’s ever had to do in flight which is ‘turn my rotor off.’”\nOther challenges include developing techniques for stowing and extending the blades. “You get onto the jet thrust [phase] but you still have the blades extended and then you’ve got to go through the fold sequence on that. Then you’ve got to be able to do that in reverse while maintaining a reasonable attitude and control margin,” Hurst says.\nFor the larger HSVTOL variants, Bell envisages using convertible engines in a similar fashion to the way in which the Pratt & Whitney F135 is used to power all phases of flight in the F-35B short take-off and vertical landing variant. The manufacturer also expects to minimize the time spent in hover, reducing conversion speed and potentially optimizing the blade design for low-speed flight.\n",

        "input": "(Nanowerk News) High-quality graphite has excellent mechanical strength, thermal stability, high flexibility and very high in-plane thermal and electric conductivities and, thus, is one of most important advanced materials for many applications, such as being used as the light thermal conductor of cell phones. For example, a specific type of graphite, Highly Ordered Pyrolytic Graphite (HOPG), is one of the mostly used lab materials.\nThese excellent properties originate from the layered structure of graphite, where the strong covalent binding between carbon atoms in a graphene layer contribute to the excellent mechanical properties, thermal and electric conductivities and the very weak interaction between graphene layers leads to the highly flexibility of graphite.\nAlthough graphite has been discovered in nature for more 1000 years and its artificial synthesis has been explored for more than 100 years, the quality of graphite samples, either natural ones or synthesized ones, are far from ideal. Such as the size of the largest single crystalline graphite domains in graphitic materials are generally less than 1 mm, which is in sharp contrast to the size of many crystals, such as the size of quartz single crystal and silicon single crystals may reach meter scale.\nThe very small size of single crystalline graphite is due to the weak interaction between graphite layers, where the flatness of a graphene layer is hard to be maintained during the growth process and, thus, a graphite can be easily breaks into a few single crystals with disordered grain boundaries (See Figure 1).\nTo solve the critical issue, Distinguished Professor of Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) and his collaborators, Professor Kaihui Liu, Professor Enge Wang of Peking University, and others has proposed a strategy to synthesize single-crystalline graphite films orders of magnitude large, up to inch scale.\nIn their approach (Nature Nanotechnology, \"Continuous epitaxy of single-crystal graphite films by isothermal carbon diffusion through nickel\"), single crystalline Ni foils are used as a substrate and caron atoms are supplied from the back side of the Ni foils through an “isothermal dissolution-diffusion-precipitation process” (See Figure 2).\nInstead of using gas phase carton source, they choose solid carbon materials to feed the graphite growth. Such a new strategy allows of ~1 inch single crystalline graphite films of 35 ?m thick, or more than 100,000 graphene layers, within a few days. The single crystalline graphite has the recorded thermal conductivity of ?2,880 Wm-1K-1, negligible impurity contents and smallest layer distances in compare with all available graphite samples.\n“This success really on a few critical issues of the experimental design: (1) the successful synthesis of large size single crystalline Ni films serves as an ultra-flat substrate and thus the disorders in the synthesized graphite can be avoided; (2) the isothermal growth of 100,000 graphene layers over ~ 100 hours allows every graphene layer be synthesized under exact same chemical environment and temperature thus ensure the uniformity of the graphite quality; (3) continuous carbon feeding through the back side of the Ni foil allows the contiguous growth of graphene layers in a very large growth rate, ~ one layer per five seconds,” Professor Ding explained.\nMultilayer van der Waals (vdW) film materials have attracted extensive interest from the perspective of both fundamental research and technology. However, the synthesis of large, thick, single-crystal vdW materials remains a great challenge because the lack of out-of-plane chemical bonds weakens the epitaxial relationship between neighbouring layers. Here we report the continuous epitaxial growth of single-crystal graphite films with thickness up to 100,000 layers on high-index, single-crystal nickel (Ni) foils. Our epitaxial graphite films demonstrate high single crystallinity, including an ultra-flat surface, centimetre-size single-crystal domains and a perfect AB-stacking structure. The exfoliated graphene shows excellent physical properties, such as a high thermal conductivity of ~2,880?W?m?1?K?1, intrinsic Young’s modulus of ~1.0?TPa and low doping density of ~2.2?×?1010?cm?2. The growth of each single-crystal graphene layer is realized by step edge-guided epitaxy on a high-index Ni surface, and continuous growth is enabled by the isothermal dissolution–diffusion–precipitation of carbon atoms driven by a chemical potential gradient between the two Ni surfaces. The isothermal growth enables the layers to grow at optimal conditions, without stacking disorders or stress gradients in the final graphite. Our findings provide a facile and scalable avenue for the synthesis of high-quality, thick vdW films for various applications.\n",

From its stealthy design to its secretive history, the Blackbird simply screams cool—and it also helps that it’s the fastest air-breathing (a.k.a. “not a rocket”) crewed aircraft in human history.\nAviation company Hermeus successfully demonstrated mode transition between turbojet and ramjet engines for the Air Force’s Quarterhorse hypersonic aircraft, a major hypersonic flight milestone.\nCapable of flying in excess of Mach 3.2 (around 2,200 mph), the SR-71 has been the pinnacle of aviation speed for nearly half a century, but the Atlanta-based aviation company Hermeus thinks it’s time for a little competition. The company’s vision of hypersonic flight (meaning speeds faster than Mach 5) isn’t one reserved for clandestine spy missions, however. That’s because Hermeus wants to bring hypersonic airliners to an airport near you.\nIn 2021, the Air Force awarded Hermeus a $60 million contract to develop three uncrewed concept aircraft, including the hypersonic “Quarterhorse.” Late last year, Hermeus passed a major milestone by successfully firing a turbojet-ramjet hybrid engine, known as “Chimera.”\nThe air-breathing monster behind the powerful SR-71 is a Pratt & Whitney J58 turbojet engine, which maxes out at speeds around Mach 3. In Hermeus’s hypersonic design, a ramjet, which can only operate at high speeds as it uses this air to pressurize air and fuel in the combustion chamber, kicks in and carries the theoretical Quarterhorse aircraft to Mach 5 and beyond. For any plane hoping to dethrone the Blackbird, its engine needs to somehow seamlessly transition between turbojet, ramjet, and back to turbojet—and Hermeus has already pulled off that delicate piece of aviation engineering.\n",

Liquid specimens are vacuum-incompatible, so they cannot be directly probed in traditional TEM.\nFortunately, with the emergence of the more advanced in-situ \"liquid cell TEM,\" it is possible to studyliquid phasedynamic processes in situ, such as observing crystal nucleation and growth in solution, electrochemical reactions in energy devices, and the life activities of living cells.\nThe \"liquid cell\" is a core component of TEM to hold the specimens for theelectron beamto pass through, thus enabling in-situ observation. But it is challenging to manufacture a high-quality liquid cell for TEM because it involves incorporating electrodes and encapsulating electrolytes in a tiny \"closed\" liquid cell to prevent leakage and connect it to an external power source at the same time.\nA research team co-led by Dr. Zeng Zhiyuan, Assistant Professor in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at CityU, and Professor Li Ju from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) successfully developed an efficient and novel method to fabricate \"closed\" electrochemical liquid cells, which can greatly improve the resolution of TEM with liquid samples.\n\"The newly developed closed liquid cell performs two main jobs: (1) enclosing the liquid samples in a closed container, thereby separating them from the microscope vacuum environment; and (2) confining the liquid samples to a thin enough liquid layer using two electron-transparent silicon nitride (SiNx) windows, so that electrons can travel through the liquid layer and image the reactions,\" explained Dr. Zeng.\nTo manufacture the high-performance, \"closed\" electrochemical liquid cells in this protocol, the research team used advanced nanofabrication techniques, including photolithography, to fabricate the core component of in situ liquid TEM—the liquid cell. Photolithography is a process that usesultraviolet lightto transfer a geometric design from an optical mask to a light-sensitive chemical (photoresist) coated on the substrate.\nThe team fabricated the bottom chip and top chip separately, and then assembled them together. Gold or titanium electrodes were deposited on the bottom chip during the metal deposition process. Then the electrolyte was loaded and sealed inside the liquid cell.\nUsing this innovative liquid cell with the transmission electron microscope, the dynamic electrochemical reactions of the liquid sample on the electrode surface can be recorded in real time at high resolution through the TEM operating system incorporated with a high spatio-temporal resolution camera.\n\"The electrochemical liquid cell designed by our customized nanofabrication method has thinner SiNximaging windows (35nm) than commercial ones (50nm),\" explained Dr. Zeng. \"It also has a thinner liquid layer (150nm) than that of commercial ones (1,000 nm). The thinner SiNximaging windows and thinner liquid layer ensure that our fabricated liquid cell can capture electrochemical reactions with better TEM spatial resolution than commercial ones can.\"\nThe team believes that a lot of opportunities and applications for the in-situ TEM observation of electrochemical reactions will emerge soon after the development of the electrochemical liquid cell with the selection of patterned metal electrodes and the encapsulated liquid electrolytes in the liquid cell.\nThis newly proposed fabrication protocol can also be utilized in other in-situ techniques beyond TEM. For example, a proper adjustment to this protocol would be suitable for the fabrication of electrochemical liquid cells for in-situ X-ray characterizations of electrochemical reactions (X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, etc.).\n",

Chance Saltzman, U.S. chief of space operations, said Jan. 31.\nSaltzmanassumed commandof the Space Force in November and recently announcedhis prioritiesfor the coming year, one of which is to field “combat ready forces.”\nThat means “we have to be resilient, we have to be ready, and we have to be combat credible,” Saltzman told reporters at the Pentagon.\nHe noted that one of the takeaways so far from thewar in Ukraineis that space systems are increasingly essential to military operations, and that satellites and the ground systems used to control them are being targeted. The challenge for the U.S. military is that itssatellites are vulnerable, and Space Force operators have not been trained for this new era of anti-satellite warfare.\nThe Space Force is moving to modernize its constellations to be more resilient against threats but having advanced systems doesn’t ensure a ready force, said Saltzman. “The personnel have to be trained. We have to have operational concepts, we have to have tactics that are validated, the operators have to practice those tactics. We need intelligence to underpin how we’re going to use those systems.”\nSaltzman said there is funding in the 2024 budget for these initiatives. “I can’t give you the specific numbers yet. But we are investing in developing what I’m loosely calling an ‘operational test and training infrastructure.’” he said.\nThe training and testing infrastructure includes virtual simulators, training ranges and digital twin environments to test equipment in a realistic setting, he said.\nIn Ukraine there have been widely reportedincidents of cyber attacksagainst satellite-based communications systems and electronicjamming of GPSnavigation signals. But the Space Force has to be prepared to respond to a wider range of scenarios, including the most “stressing” ones likely to be posed by China, he said. “I want to have a lot of flexible options against all the threats, regardless of what is asked of us.”\nSaltzman said he supports efforts by Space Force procurement organizations toaccelerate innovation in satellitesand ground systems. But he said a priority also will be “high fidelity simulators, a virtual training environment, having the range infrastructure to practice this capability, we have to buy all that equipment as well. And we have to buy it quickly.”\n“The United States should not cede access to this emerging economic zone of activity to nations notorious for claiming territory and resources by force or threat of force such as Russia or China,” Bates argued. To provide security in the lunar region, the Space Force would have to deploy “enabling capabilities including satellite communications, position, navigation, and timing, space domain awareness, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance space systems.”\n",

Raytheon won a potential $847.6 million contract in June 2018 for the OTH-WS project.\nRaytheon is building the new missile in partnership with Kongsberg Gruppen in Kongsberg, Norway. The missile is to equip the littoral combat ship and FFG(X) future frigate with stand-off surface-to-surface weapons capability.\nRaytheon and Kongsberg in their initial OTH-WS bid offered the Naval Strike Missile (NSM) -- a fifth-generation long-range, precision-strike missile that offers strike capability against heavily defended land and sea targets. NSM is a modernized version of the Norwegian Penguin anti-ship missile.\nThe passive subsonic sea-skimming missile can penetrate advanced enemy defense systems, and has an upgraded seeker and target identification, Raytheon officials say. The NSM is aboard Norway's new frigate and coastal corvette, and gives surface warships sufficient firepower to defeat evolving threats.\nThe NSM uses composite materials for enhanced stealth, and a titanium-alloy blast-and-fragmentation warhead with void-sensing programmable intelligent multi-purpose fuze for use against hard targets like surface ships.\nThe missile has an imaging infrared seeker, an onboard target database, and navigates by Global Positioning System (GPS), inertial sensors, and terrain-reference systems. It can detect, recognize, and discriminate among targets independently, and is designed to strike enemy ships at or near the water line to inflict maximum structural damage.\nAboard ships, NSMs can be deck-mounted in packs of one, two, three, four, or six launchers. The NSM weighs about 880 pounds and has a range of about 100 nautical miles. It can be used in littoral waters near coasts, or in the open ocean. The missile can fly over and around land masses, travel in sea-skim mode, and then make random maneuvers in terminal phase to avoid enemy countermeasures.\nRaytheon will build a NSM fire-control suite with operator interface, interfaces to the launchers, engagement planning system, and interface to host ship systems like GPS and inertial navigation systems. Its fire-control system will be able to launch from four to 16 missiles.\nOn this order Raytheon and Kongsberg will do the work in Kongsberg and Raufoss, Norway; Tucson, Ariz.; Schrobenhausen, Germany; McKinney, Texas; and Louisville, Ky., and should be finished by May 2024.\n",

        "input": "WASHINGTON — Small launch vehicle developer Astra Space filed an application with the Federal Communications Commission Nov. 4 to deploy a constellation of more than 13,600 satellites that would provide broadband services.\nThe constellation, Astra said, would provide services at V-band frequencies, with the 13,620 satellites deployed into low Earth orbit in three phases to provide global coverage. The satellite could use other frequencies as well, the company noted, but those services are not included in this application.\n“The Astra Constellation will provide global secure, high-bandwidth connectivity to enable communications services, environmental and natural resource applications, and national security missions,” the company said inits application. “Given the financing secured through its recent public offering, vertically integrated launch capability, and space systems design and operations experience, Astra is well-positioned to develop this project and to introduce new space-based services, including communications solutions, while maintaining a safe space environment, utilizing spectrum efficiently and without causing harmful radiofrequency interference.”\nThe first phase of the constellation would involve a single plane of 40 satellites in an equatorial orbit at an altitude of 700 kilometers. “This Phase is designed to allow Astra to introduce continuous service in a test market as soon as possible, learn from initial operations and customer feedback, and iteratively improve all elements of the service to better meet customer needs,” the company stated.\nA second phase would launch 2,296 satellites into sun-synchronous and mid-inclination orbits at altitudes of 690 to 700 kilometers. That would allow the company to provide global service. A third phase, with 11,284 satellites, would operate in orbits from 380 to 400 kilometers to provide additional capacity.\nEach satellite will have a “novel” phased-array antenna with an effective aperture of 20 centimeters along with two gimbaled parabolic antennas. The spacecraft will be equipped with electric propulsion systems for maneuvering and deorbiting. Astra acquired Apollo Fusion, a developer of electric propulsion systems for satellites, earlier this year.\nThe application did not disclose the size of the satellites, but noted that the satellites, which will be built in-house by Astra, can be launched at least two at a time on the company’s rockets. The payload of those rockets is slated to increase over the next several years, with a goal of 500 kilograms. Astra, though, did note it is “willing and able to utilize third party launch providers in part or in whole for Constellation deployment.”\nAstra had not previously disclosed plans for a broadband satellite constellation. It did announce earlier this year that it would get into the satellite business, developing satellite buses designed for launch on its rockets that could carry a wide range of payloads for customers, but didn’t discuss any intent to develop its own constellation.\nThe filing was one of several that companies made with the FCC on Nov. 4, a deadline set by the FCC three months earlier for the latest processing round for V-band satellite systems. Hughes Network Systems, Inmarsat and Telesat also filed applications for V-band satellite constellations, but none anywhere near as large as what Astra proposed.\nIn the near term, Astra is gearing up for its next attempt to reach orbit with its Rocket 3.3 vehicle. The company tweeted Nov. 3 that the earliest launch opportunity for that rocket from its Kodiak Island, Alaska, site is Nov. 8, during a window that runs through Nov. 14.\nThe vehicle, called LV0007, will be Astra’s fourth attempt to reach orbit and the first since an Aug. 28 launch attempt. On that launch, one of five first-stage engines shut down within a second of liftoff, causing the vehicle to drift sideways for nearly 15 seconds before it depleted enough propellant that the thrust from the remaining engines could allow the rocket to ascend. The launch was terminated two minutes later around the time of reaching maximum dynamic pressure.\nAn investigation concludedthat a quick-disconnect system for fuel lines malfunctioned, allowing fuel to leak through it and be ignited by engine exhaust. That created an “over-pressure event” that caused a fuel pump to turn off, shutting down an engine.\nIn addition to its upcoming launch, Astra is also scheduled to release its third quarter financial results Nov. 11.\n",

Gen. B. Chance Saltzman.\nSpeaking during a Defense Writers Group discussion this morning, Saltzman told reporters that “we are faster” compared to adversaries concerning acquisitions, pointing to the work of theSpaceAcquisition Council and Program Integration Council in coordinating programmatic requirements and goals.\n“And I’m saying this from somebody who’s been watching this for 30 yearswithan operator’s level of impatience,” Saltzman, a former Minuteman III launch officer and satellite operator, added.\nThe joint coordination, as well as advanced modeling and growing relationshipswiththe private sector, have enabled theSpaceForceto “compress” the timeline down for acquisitions, Saltzman said, work that is being done in tandemwithreevaluating key objectives for the service.\n“We’re going through a very introspective period where we’re looking at our operational concepts,” Saltzman noted. TheSpaceForceis still working through how to fully define goals likespacedomain awareness, achievingspacesuperiority and the measures necessary to protect the jointforce, he added, an issue exacerbated by emerging technological threats.\nThe danger posed by a hypersonic missile, for example, has prompted the need for new sensor and tracking capabilities, like the Next-Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared missile warning system, that is currently under development.\n“A non-ballistic hypersonic threat is different than a ballistic threat over the poles,” Saltzman observed. “In the way that we were optimized around ballistic trajectories, we have to change the models now to account for non-ballistic trajectories.”\nSatellite infrastructure is changing as well, Saltzman remarked. Commercial infrastructure such as Starlink, which has been successfully utilized for military missions in the war in Ukraine, has underscored the importance of launching constellations of variously sized satellites.\n“We’re seeing the value of proliferating constellations,” he said. “They’re very hard to deny because it’s such a widespread set of targets.”\nAs Russia and China expand theirspacecapabilities, Saltzman said the two leading adversaries are not currently pursuing a similar diversified satellite infrastructure.\n“Right now, the better way to characterize what the adversary is doing is just in basic capacity,” he said. “While we see some diversification of orbits, we’re not seeing the mega constellations in direct support like we see in the commercial side and we’re trying to take advantage of.”\nThrough theSpaceDevelopment Agency, the Pentagon is designing its own constellation called the Transport Layer, which SDA Policy Chief Paula Trimble previously described as key to future warfighting. The Transport Layer, whose first launch is scheduled for this October, will support satellite communications and provide critical infrastructure for the Defense Department’s Joint All Domain Command and Control initiative.\nIntegrating the five domains -- air, land, sea,spaceand cyber -- is “the next generation of warfare broadly,” Saltzman said,withspaceserving as a critical component of the matrix of capabilities.\n“This is notforceonforce. I think those days are behind us,” he added. “This is about your matrix versus my matrix and who’s going to break first.”\nTo meet that challenge, the service will have to focus onspacejust as much as what’s happening on earth, according to Saltzman.\n“We’re going to have to do things differently and better. We have this traditional view of intelligence fromspacelooking down to characterize the terrestrial domains,” he said. “The need is to realize there’s intelligence above the Earth inspace, and that we now have to look up and make sure we understand what’s going on there.”\n",

A used fuel encapsulation plant is to be built at the existing Zwilag interim storage facility.\nSix sites were proposed in November 2011 during the first stage of the process - which began in 2008 - for selecting sites for two repositories: one for low- and intermediate-level waste (LLW/ILW), the other for high-level waste (HLW). The repository for LLW/ILW is planned to be in operation by 2050, with the one for HLW planned to be operational ten years later.\nStage two of the site selection process, which began in late 2011, aimed to narrow down the sites under investigation to at least two for each of the repositories. Nagra proposed in January 2015 that further investigations be carried out at the proposed siting regions of Zürich Nordost and Jura Ost in the third and final stage of the selection process. It said the four other regions under consideration in the second stage - Südranden, N?rdlich L?gern, Jura-Südfuss and Wellenberg - would be placed in reserve. However, in December 2016, the Swiss Federal Nuclear Safety Inspectorate (ENSI) proposed that the N?rdlich L?gern region also be included in the final stage.\nFollowing the completion of the second stage of the site selection process, the Federal Council made the decision at a meeting in November 2018 to include the N?rdlich L?gern region in further investigations. In addition, the regions of Jura-Südfuss, Südranden and Wellenberg remain reserve options.\nNagra has now proposed that N?rdlich L?gern should host a combined repository that is suitable for all types of radioactive waste.

A second booster test is scheduled for this month, and the service plans on testing an all-up-round missile this year.\nThe committee members worry that — if further issues arise in testing — they would result in a problem called “concurrency,” where program officials attempt to test, correct problems, and produce missiles all at the same time.\n“The committee notes that the flight test regimen for the rapid prototyping program has become increasingly delayed and compressed, increasing the concurrency risk to the first production lot of weapons funded in this account,” lawmakers stated in the report.\nDespite the proposed cut to ARRW funding, House appropriators stressed their support of the program, noting that the committee fully funded ongoing research and development expenses for ARRW and that procurement of four missiles would be sufficient for the Air Force to meet early operational capability.\nThe committee also allocated funds for “engineering change orders” that would allow the Air Force to address problems found in upcoming flight tests.\nIf those tests proceed smoothly, the report said the committee would also support redistributing the funding meant for engineering changes to ARRW procurement — thus allowing the Air Force to potentially buy up to all 12 missiles it originally requested.\nWhether House appropriators’ recommendations will be turned into law is yet to be seen. The Senate Appropriations Committee has not finalized its own spending bill, and it is unclear whether they will have similar reservations about the ARRW program.\nThe Air Force chose Lockheed Martin to design and manufacture ARRW in 2018, awarding it a contract worth up to $480 million for development activities that include the critical design review, testing and production readiness support.\nThe service has not publicly declared how many ARRW missiles it ultimately plans to buy. The weapon has been tested aboard the B-52, and Air Force officials have said the B-1 bomber and F-15EX Eagle II could also potentially field ARRW further down the line.\n",

        "input": "“When it comes to this war in Ukraine, it is truly the competent use of quadcopters for a variety of tasks, including for artillery and mortar units, that has really made this cheap, available, expendable (unmanned aerial vehicle), very lethal and very dangerous,” says Samuel Bendett, an analyst at the Center for Naval Analysis and adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security.\nThe war in Ukraine has exposed that widely available, inexpensive drones are being used not just for targeted killings but for wholesale slaughter.\nWhen the United States first fired a missile from an armed Predator drone at suspected Al Qaeda leaders in Afghanistan on November 14, 2001, it was clear that warfare had permanently changed. During the two decades that followed, drones became the most iconic instrument of the war on terror. Highly sophisticated, multimillion-dollar US drones were repeatedly deployed in targeted killing campaigns. But their use worldwide was limited to powerful nations.\nThen, as the navigation systems and wireless technologies in hobbyist drones and consumer electronics improved, a second style of military drone appeared—not in Washington, but in Istanbul. And it caught the world’s attention in Ukraine in 2022, when it proved itself capable of holding back one of the most formidable militaries on the planet. \nThe Bayraktar TB2 drone, a Turkish-made aircraft from the Baykar corporation, marks a new chapter in the still-new era of drone warfare. Cheap, widely available drones have changed how smaller nations fight modern wars. Although Russia’s invasion of Ukraine brought these new weapons into the popular consciousness, there’s more to their story.\nExplosions in Armenia, broadcast on YouTube in 2020, revealed this new shape of war to the world. There, in a blue-tinted video, a radar dish spins underneath cyan crosshairs until it erupts into a cloud of smoke. The action repeats twice: a crosshair targets a vehicle mounted with a spinning dish sensor, its earthen barriers no defense against aerial attack, leaving an empty crater behind.\nThe clip, released on YouTube on September 27, 2020, was one of many the Azerbaijan military published during the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War, which it launched against neighboring Armenia that same day. The video was recorded by the TB2.\nIt encompasses all the horrors of war, with the added voyeurism of an unblinking camera.\nIn that conflict and others, the TB2 has filled a void in the arms market created by the US government’s refusal to export its high-end Predator family of drones. To get around export restrictions on drone models and other critical military technologies, Baykar turned to technologies readily available on the commercial market to make a new weapon of war.\nThe TB2 is built in Turkey from a mix of domestically made parts and parts sourced from international commercial markets. Investigations of downed Bayraktars have revealed components sourced from US companies, including a GPS receiver made by Trimble, an airborne modem/transceiver made by Viasat, and a Garmin GNC 255 navigation radio. Garmin, which makes consumer GPS products, released a statement noting that its navigation unit found in TB2s “is not designed or intended for military use, and it is not even designed or intended for use in drones.” But it’s there.\nCommercial technology makes the TB2 appealing for another reason: while the US-made Reaper drone costs $28 million, the TB2 only costs about $5 million. Since its development in 2014, the TB2 has shown up in conflicts in Azerbaijan, Libya, Ethiopia, and now Ukraine. The drone is so much more affordable than traditional weaponry that Lithuanians have run crowdfunding campaigns to help buy them for Ukrainian forces.\nThe TB2 is just one of several examples of commercial drone technology being used in combat. The same DJI Mavic quadcopters that help real estate agents survey property have been deployed in conflicts in Burkina Faso and the Donbas region of Ukraine. Other DJI drone models have been spotted in Syria since 2013, and kit-built drones, assembled from commercially available parts, have seen widespread use.\nThese cheap, good-enough drones that are free of export restrictions have given smaller nations the kind of air capabilities previously limited to great military powers. While that proliferation may bring some small degree of parity, it comes with terrible human costs. Drone attacks can be described in sterile language, framed as missiles stopping vehicles. But what happens when that explosive force hits human bodies is visceral, tragic. It encompasses all the horrors of war, with the added voyeurism of an unblinking camera whose video feed is monitored by a participant in the attack who is often dozens, if not thousands, of miles away.\nWhat’s more, as these weapons proliferate, larger powers will increasingly employ them in conventional warfare rather than rely on targeted killings. When Ukraine proved it was capable of holding back the Russian invasion, Russia unleashed a terror campaign against Ukrainian civilians via Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones. These self-detonating drones, which Russia launches in salvos, contain commercial parts from US companies. The waves of drone attacks have largely been intercepted by Ukrainian air defenses, but some have killed civilians. Because the Shahed-136 drones are so cheap to make, estimated at around $20,000, intercepting them with a more expensive missile incurs a cost to the defender. \nExport potential\nThe TB2 was developed by MIT graduate Selcuk Bayraktar, who researched advanced vertical landing patterns for drones while at the university. His namesake drone is a fixed-wing plane with modest specifications. It can communicate at a range of around 186 miles from its ground station and travels at 80 mph to 138 mph. At those speeds, a TB2 can stay in the sky for over 24 hours, comparable to higher-end drones like the Reaper and Gray Eagle.\nFrom altitudes of up to 25,000 feet, the TB2 surveys the ground below, sharing video to coordinate long-range attacks or movements, or releasing laser-guided bombs on people, vehicles, or buildings.\nBut its most unique characteristic, says James Rogers, associate professor in war studies at the Danish Institute for Advanced Study, is that it’s “the first mass-produced drone system that medium and smaller states can get hold of.”\nBefore Baykar developed the TB2, the Turkish military wanted to buy Predator and Reaper drones from the US. Those are the remotely piloted planes that defined the US’s long wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. But drone exports from the US are governed by the Missile Technology Control Regime, a treaty whose members agree to limit access to particular types of weapons. The Trump administration relaxed adherence to these rules in 2020 (a change upheld by the Biden administration), but the previous enforcement of the rules, combined with concern that Turkey would use the drones to violate human rights, prevented a sale in 2012.\nTurkey is not alone in being denied the ability to purchase US-made drones. Critics of the treaty point out that the US could sell fighter jets that require human pilots to Egypt and other countries, but won’t sell those same countries armed drones.\nBut commercial and military technology have a way of driving each other. Silicon Valley is largely an outgrowth of Cold War military technology research, and consumer electronics, especially those tied to computing and navigation systems, have long been subsidized by military research. GPS was once a military technology so sensitive that civilian use of the signal was intentionally degraded until 2000.\nDrones used in combat\nHobbyist drones and military versions made with commercial parts have changed the economics of war.\nNow, commercial access to the full signal, in conjunction with cheap and powerful commercial GPS receivers like the one found in the Bayraktar, allows drones to perform at near-military standards, without special access to military signals or congressional oversight. \nThe Turkish military debuted the Bayraktar in 2016, targeting members of the PKK, a Kurdish militia. Since then, the drone has seen action with several other militaries, most famously Ukraine and Azerbaijan but also on one side of the Libyan Civil War. In 2022, the small West African nation of Togo, with a military budget of just under $114 million, purchased a consignment of Bayraktar TB2s.\n\"We got to the point where these drones are deciding the fate of nations.” James Rogers\n“I think Turkey has made a real conscious decision to focus on the purchase and development of the TB2, making it cheaper and more widely available—in some cases ‘free’ through donations,” says Rogers.\nIn 2021 Ethiopia received the TB2 and other foreign-supplied drones, which it used to halt and then reverse an advance by Tigrayan rebels on the capital that its ground forces couldn’t stop. Battlefield casualties directly resulting from the drones are hard to assess, but drone strikes on Tigrayan-held areas after the advance was halted killed at least 56 civilians.\n“It is astonishing to think that Turkish drones, if we believe the accounts in Ethiopia, made the difference between an African nation’s regime falling or surviving. We got to the point where these drones are deciding the fate of nations,” says Rogers.\nWar hobbyists\nThe TB2, while modest in its abilities relative to other military drones, is an advanced piece of equipment that requires ground stations and a stretch of road to launch. But it reflects only one end of the spectrum of mass-market drones that have found their way onto battlefields. At the other end is the humble quadcopter.\nBy 2016, ISIS had modified DJI Phantom quadcopters to drop grenades. These weapons joined the arsenal of scratch-built ISIS drones, using parts that investigators with Conflict Armament Research had traced to mass-market commercial suppliers. This tactic spread and was soon common among armed groups. In 2018, Ukrainian forces fighting in Donetsk used a modified DJI Mavic to drop bombs on trenches held by Russian-backed separatists. Today these Chinese drones are found virtually anywhere in the world where there is combat. \n“When it comes to this war in Ukraine, it is truly the competent use of quadcopters for a variety of tasks, including for artillery and mortar units, that has really made this cheap, available, expendable (unmanned aerial vehicle), very lethal and very dangerous,” says Samuel Bendett, an analyst at the Center for Naval Analysis and adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security.\nIn April 2022, China’s hobbyist drone maker DJI announced it was suspending all sales in Ukraine and Russia. But its quadcopters, especially the popular and affordable Mavic family, still find their way into military use, as soldiers buy and deploy the drones themselves. Sometimes regional governments even pitch in.\nEven if these drones don’t release bombs, soldiers have learned to fear the buzzing of quadcopter engines overhead as the flights often presage an incoming artillery barrage. In one moment, a squad is a flicker of light, visible in thermal imaging, captured by a drone camera and shared with the tablet of an enemy hiding nearby. In the next, the soldiers’ execution is filmed from above, captured in 4K resolution by a weapon available for sale at any Best Buy.\n",

        "input": "The demonstration showcased multiple drones providing a 24-hour defensive perimeter, as well as AI-based mission planningByMike Ball/ 14 Sep 2022\nThe following news story originally appeared on the British Army website here.\nA breakthrough in technology and innovation for the British Army took place on Salisbury Plain recently, where a demonstration of multiple Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) took place. Funded by Army Headquarters, the nano-Unmanned Aerial Systems (nUAS) project completed a live multiple drone demonstration also known as swarming drones, pushing technological boundaries.\nLieutenant Colonel Arthur Dawe, Commanding Officer, Infantry Trials and Development Unit (ITDU) explains: “We are working in collaboration with the Future Capabilities Group (FCG), part of the Defence Equipment & Support (DE&S) construct. The stand-out feature of this event is that you are seeing a military operator control more than one drone at the same time from one single unit. This is adding scale and adding complexity with each drone able to carry out a separate task.”\nHe added: “This is a real amplifier, adding capacity, force protection, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities. The intent going forward is to add a precision strike capability; this will not only assist in our targeting but also in our strike capability, therefore making us more lethal at range which will protect our very valuable forces and people.”\nThe event was also ground-breaking in terms of the regulatory environment too, as it was the first time the Military Aviation Authority has issued a categorisation of this type for a swarm to be operated by one operator, a huge achievement for the Army and hopefully paving the way for systems like this to come into service.\nTwo different UAS systems were used; the first was the Atlas, where one operator controls four drones on a tablet via individual manual mission taskings. The second system was the Elbit, where one operator tasks six drones, creating autonomous missions. This means the operator can task up to six drones in a fleet on the same mission or various other missions to complete different tasks.\nThe focus was on two showcase ideas; the first consisted of multiple drones providing a 24-hour perimeter defensive posture, with surveillance provided by multiple UAS in and around a specific location.\nThe second scenario worked on artificial intelligence communicating with the system to plan UAS missions, so that they can provide overwatch and inform the user of any points of interest and following where necessary.\nDominic Ferrett, Lead UAS Engineer (DE&S) (FCG), noted: “This is a significant achievement for the FCG and the Army. We have now proved the concept that one person can fly six drones thus creating a reduction in operator burden.”\n“In the future we want one operator to control six, twelve, thirty, forty or more drones as part of a more integrated swarm. As we move further with future Army projects we look to human-machine teaming, which will start to bring in ground elements as well as air elements as a combined system.”\nThese demonstrations gave the UAS community the opportunity to share working knowledge and experiences. It will help to continue the work to develop UK Defence’s UAS capabilities across the Tri-Service.\nFlight Lieutenant David Morrison, Surveillance Target and Acquisition (STA) ITDU, commented: “Drones are at the forefront of technology right now and this is a real stepping stone in terms of capability. We’ve seen military operators flying these systems, not the manufacturers, and everything you see has been put together by the military operators and all flown by ourselves. This is the first steps to get soldiers using this kit and equipment.”\nLance Corporal Kai Webb, ITDU, STA operates the swarms: “I never knew that drones were a thing in the Army before I came here. Using this controller and multiple drones provides me with great visibility in the area around me. This type of technology will be a massive help when rolled out to units in the future, assisting with reconnaissance and the security of specific areas and bases too.”\n“To me personally, I like the fact that you don’t have to walk up a massive hill to see what is happening on the other side. You can just send in the drone to get eyes on which offers less risk to the soldier on the ground.”\n",

At a Chinese shipyard, the keel-laying ceremony was held for a barge that will later be fitted with two RITM-200S reactors.\nThe keel laying ceremony (Image: Atomenergomash)\nThe barge will measure 140 metres long and 30 metres wide, said Rosatom, and will feature structures for containment and radioactive waste storage as well as fuel tanks for diesel, according to previous TASS reports. On delivery to Atomenergomash by the end of next year the barge will weigh 9549 tons and when fitted out with two RITM-200S pressurised water reactors and all the equipment it needs to function as a power plant it will weigh some 19,088 tons. The reactor components are already being manufactured.\nAtomflot will then take control as the owner and operator of the floating nuclear power plant when it is complete. It will be transferred to Cape Nagloynyn in the Russian Arctic where it will supply 105 MWe to a new port and the forthcoming Baimskaya copper and gold mine. This is scheduled to happen by 2027.\nIn total, the Baimskaya development requires around 300 MWe, therefore three such floating power plants are needed, while a fourth will be installed as backup for outages during refuelling and maintenance.\nAndrey Nikipelov, head of Atomenergomash said: \"This project begins the history of a whole family of floating nuclear power plants, different in capacity and purpose - in the Arctic and tropical versions, which Atomenergomash is ready to offer to the market and which undoubtedly have a very serious potential for the implementation of large industrial projects and exports.\"\nRussia already has one floating nuclear power plant, the Akademik Lomonosov, which is stationed at Pevek where it supplies heat and power to the town. This is based on two KLT-40S reactors generating 35 MWe each, which are similar to those used in a previous generation of nuclear powered icebreakers. So-called 'modernised floating nuclear power plants' like the ones for Cape Nagloynyn feature reactors from the new RITM series, as used in the latest generation of icebreakers.

That’s a factual thing,” Stoltenberg said. For example, the waiting time for militaries to receive large-caliber ammunition has increased from 12 to 28 months. “Orders placed today will only be delivered two-and-a-half years later,” he added.\nFor the past several months, NATO has undergone an “extraordinary, out-of-cycle” survey of its stockpiles and plans to decide on new capability target guidelines during the Feb. 14-15 defense ministerial, he said.\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine nearly one year ago, NATO allies found that the only way to support the defending nation’s need for artillery was “to dig into our existing stocks,” he noted. “But of course, in the long run, we cannot continue to do that.”\nNATO members are working with their respective defense industries to launch new multi-year procurement deals for ammunition and other defense capabilities, Stoltenberg said.\nFrance’s Ministry of Defense last week announced five new actions meant to bolster production cycles. They include increasing the use of multi-year contracts, simplifying program requirements, securing supply chains to eliminate delays in production, supporting industry recruitment efforts, and securing access to private funding networks for France’s defense industry.\nMeanwhile, Norway last month announced a deal worth 2.6 billion Krone (U.S. $257 million) to procure artillery shells from Nammo, in a deal hailed by the nation’s defense minister as the largest ever,according to reports.\nThe United States has also focused on replenishing its munitions stockpiles, though some defense firms have signaled they won’t expand capacity without firm government commitments in spite of growing defense spending and demand for arms fueled by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\nThe U.S. Congress has backed multiyear purchases of certain munitions, and U.S. Army officials say they are undergoing the fastest artillery ramp up since the Korean War.\nWhile some munition production boosts have begun, U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks is leading an effort to unclog industrial bottlenecks.\n",

        "input": "Remains of a Russian missile Ukrainian forces reportedly shot down in the southern region of the country on Nov. 15, 2022. Photo from the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine via Facebook.\nFor months now, Ukraine has faced a barrage of Russian missile and drone attacks, straining its Soviet-era air defenses. But as the U.S. and its allies work to provide Ukraine with upgraded technology to defend against those strikes, an open-source intelligence analysis has found the Russian missiles have plenty of U.S. technology of their own.\nIn a Jan. 10 briefing, analysts from the Royal Institute of Strategic Studies, detailed how many of Russia’s missiles have American and other Western components, despite export controls in place.\n“All of these pieces of equipment were absolutely filled with Western components,” James Byrne, the Director of the Open Source Intelligence and Analysis Research Group at RUSI, said. “For us, it’s very interesting, very surprising. Nearly everything that we found in those systems was manufactured, designed by American companies.”\nBryne said RUSI was able to conduct its extensive assessments in part because Ukraine has offered up weapons it has shot down, captured, or collected the wreckage of, for inspection by analysts. \n“As the course of the war progressed, a lot of the components that we saw in these platforms and that we have since seen in these platforms are relatively new,” Byrne said. “The Russians have been doing it for a really long time, and they’re still doing it now.” \nByrne said the two largest suppliers of tech it found in Russian weapons were the U.S.-based Analog Devices and Texas Instruments—much of that technology has non-military applications, making a crackdown on their export harder. And according to the British think tank, Russia has various schemes to smuggle technology into the country, including front companies in third countries. \nThe U.S. has put in place expansive export controls to prevent American technology and goods from heading to Russia since Moscow’s renewed invasion begin in February 2022. That’s on top of other steps the U.S. took after the original Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014, including the strengthening of export controls on weapons technology. \nHowever, according to RUSI, some of the weapons used by Russia in Ukraine have been made in the past year. \n“It’s always been the case that there was a huge interest in acquiring American technology,” Byrne said. “Despite Russian efforts to sort of build this sort of domestic homegrown semiconductor industry, despite the propaganda, despite the discussion about import substitution, they haven’t succeeded in doing that. I personally don’t think they will ever really be able to succeed in doing that. And so it leaves them really critically dependent on foreign technology.” \nThe Department of Commerce did not immediately reply to a request for comment from Air & Space Forces Magazine on the effectiveness of U.S. export controls. \nAs Russia has continued to pummel Ukrainian infrastructure this winter, the U.S. and its allies have sought to provide Ukraine with an integrated, modern air and missile defense network. Most recently, both the U.S. and Germany have pledged to give the Ukrainians one of its more advanced systems: the PATRIOT air defense system.\nOn Jan. 10, Pentagon press secretary Brig. Gen. Patrick S. Ryder announced that Ukrainian soldiers will begin training to operate the PATRIOT at Fort Sill, the same place American troops are trained on the system, as soon as next week.\nDoing so will require Ukraine to pull some troops off the front lines; Training on a U.S. PATRIOT battery takes several months, though it could be expedited by skipping some steps deemed nonessential. \n“The longer those troops are off the line, they’re not actually engaged in combat, and so [we’re] trying to work with the Ukrainians to see what we can do to accelerate the training timeline,” Ryder said. “In terms of what that training will look like, it will consist of training in the classrooms, it will consist of training on the PATRIOT systems, and then of course, in a simulation lab as well before they actually deploy the capability on the battlefield.” \nRyder said Ukraine plans to send soldiers already trained in air defense to Fort Sill, where the Ukrainian troops will be instructed by the same teachers used for U.S. and allied troops who operate the system. Around 90 Ukrainians will be trained, which is the same number of troops the U.S. uses to operate its PATRIOT batteries. \nRyder also stressed the importance of not cutting too many corners in the training process, citing lessons learned from watching the Russians struggle with combined arms maneuvers due to poor training and techniques, leaving their advanced equipment less useful.\n“My understanding is that nothing will be done that would prevent this from being employed to the maximum, most effective way possible,” Ryder said. “If give you a piece of equipment, I’m simply giving you a piece of equipment, but if I give you the equipment and I give you the training, I now give you a capability. So that’s really essential here to ensuring that not only do the Ukrainians have the equipment they need to fight, but also the training that’s going to enable them to operate it on the frontline.” \n",

The solar arrays deployed in the first half-hour after separation from the Centaur upper stage of the Atlas 5 rocket that launched it early Oct. 16.\nBoth solar panels are generating power, the agency stated, and there are no other problems with the spacecraft. “In the current spacecraft attitude, Lucy can continue to operate with no threat to its health and safety,” NASA said in the statement. “The team is analyzing spacecraft data to understand the situation and determine next steps to achieve full deployment of the solar array.”\n“This team has overcome many challenges already and I am confident they will prevail here as well,” Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA associate administrator for science, tweeted Oct. 17.\nLucy’s two solar panels are each 7.3 meters in diameter. Stored in a folded configuration, they were designed to unfurl “like Chinese fans,” said Joan Salute, associate director for flight programs in NASA’s planetary science division, at a prelaunch briefing Oct. 14.\nThe arrays have a combined 51 square meters of solar cells. That large area is needed since the spacecraft will be flying out to Jupiter’s distance from the sun, where the sunlight is only a few percent as powerful as at Earth. “That enables Lucy to travel further away from the sun than any other solar-powered spacecraft to date,” said Katie Oakman, Lucy structures and mechanisms lead at Lockheed Martin Space, at the Oct. 14 briefing. Lockheed was the prime contractor for Lucy, although the solar arrays were built by Northrop Grumman.\nIn the vicinity of the Earth, Lucy’s panels can generate 18 kilowatts of power. However, when flying by the Trojan asteroids that are the destination of the mission, the arrays will produce only 500 watts of power, still sufficient to operate the spacecraft and its three main instruments.\nShe added there was no specific design requirement for circular arrays versus more conventional rectangular ones, but that those offered the most area while fitting in the confines of the Atlas payload fairing. “This particular design really enables us to stow up closely and tightly next to the spacecraft for launch,” she said. “Having any particular shape other than this really unique design wouldn’t enable us to get to that 51-meter-squared of active cell area and still fit within the launch vehicle fairing.”\nIt’s unclear if the problem will affect other work to check out the spacecraft after its launch. That includes deployment of the instrument pointing platform, on which the three major instruments are mounted, which is scheduled for about two days after launch.\n",

The test’s details and video footage were published by ISPR. The purpose of the test, according to the tweet, was to reaffirm the missile system’s design and technical parameters. Lieutenant General Nadeem Zaki Manj, Director General of the Strategic Plans Division, praised the scientists and engineers and expressed his full confidence in Pakistan’s nuclear deterrence capability.\nThe Shaheen III missile, developed by the Space & Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO) and NESCOM, is an advanced variant of the Shaheen-II missile, which was first tested on March 9, 2004, Yusuf ?etiner recalls. The Shaheen-III missile is a two-stage solid-fuel medium-range ballistic missile developed by Pakistan.\nThe Shaheen-III is a land-based surface-to-surface medium-range ballistic missile, which was test-fired for the first time on 9 March 2015. Development began in secrecy in the early 2000s in response to India's Agni-III, Shaheen was successfully tested on 9 March 2015 with a range of 2750 km (1700 mi), which enables it to strike all of India and reach deep into the Middle East parts of North Africa. The missile, according to a former Director General of Pakistan's Strategic Plans Division, is designed to reach Indian islands so that India cannot use them as “strategic bases” to establish a “second-strike capability”.\nThe Shaheen program is composed of the solid-fuel system in contrast to the Ghauri program which is primarily based on a liquid-fuel system. With the successful launch of the Shaheen-III, it surpasses the range of Shaheen-II— hence, it is the longest-range missile to be launched by the military.\nThe Shaheen-III has a range of 2,750 km and can carry both nuclear and conventional warheads. This range makes it the longest-range missile in Pakistan’s strategic arsenal. The Shaheen III missile was first tested in 2015, following a development program that began in the early 2000s in response to India’s Agni-III missile.

Credit: Jaoui et al.\nMagic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) is a graphene-based material with a unique structure, consisting of two graphene sheets layered on top of each other with a misalignment of approximately 1.1°. This unique structure has been found to host various interesting states, including correlated insulating states and unconventional superconductivity.\nPast studies examining MATBG also unveiled the emergence of what is known as a \"strange\" metal regime in the proximity of the superconducting dome, as well as a significantly enhanced electron-phonon coupling. While these observations were confirmed by later works, the exact mechanisms underpinning them remain unclear.\nResearchers at the Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, the National Institute for Material Sciences, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have recently taken a closer look at these properties of MATBG using a different, low temperature phase diagram than those utilized in previous works. Their paper, published in Nature Physics, gathered new valuable insight about the material's quantum critical behavior.\n\"Early reports on the electrical transport properties of twisted bilayer graphene revealed two fascinating features: the emergence of a so-called 'strange' metal regime in the vicinity of the superconducting dome and a sharply enhanced electron-phonon coupling,\" Alexandre Jaoui, one of the researchers who carried out the study, told Phys.org. \"Yet, both features share, under certain conditions, a common signature: a linear-in-temperature resistivity. One question that arose was: can a single microscopic mechanism, electrons scattering off phonons, account for both previous observations? Or is this signature, in the low temperature region, pointing to the existence of additional scattering centers affecting charge carriers?\"\nFrom conventional to strange metal behavior in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene\nA schematic phase diagram of the metallic ground state of hole-doped magic-angle graphene with a single superconducting dome. Credit: Jaoui et al.\nThe answers to these so-far elusive questions can only be found by examining MATBG at low temperatures, where phonons (i.e., quasiparticles associated with waves such as sound or vibration) are suppressed. In the MATBG devices reported in previous literature, however, the metallic ground state was typically hidden by an array of phase transitions.\n\"We proposed to take advantage of our 'screened' devices, in which the correlated insulators are suppressed, to study magic-angle graphene with a much simpler low-temperature phase diagram: a single superconducting dome enclosed in a metallic phase,\" Jaoui explained. \"This allowed us to focus on the latter state.\"\nTo fabricate their MATBG structure, Jaoui and his colleagues used a 'cut-and-stack' method often used by research teams examining 2D heterostructures. To encapsulate their device they used a thin layer of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN).\n\"The proximity of the graphene layers to the metallic gate allows us to suppress the low temperature insulating states and thus grants further access to the metallic ground state,\" Jaoui said. \"We then collected measurements using conventional quantum transport techniques (i.e., DC electrical transport).\"\nFrom conventional to strange metal behavior in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene\nThe research team who carried out the study. From left to right: Ipsita Das, Alexandre Jaoui, Jaime Díez-Mérida, Giorgio di Battista, Dmitri K. Efetov\nThe measurements gathered by Jaoui and his colleagues confirmed the occurrence of the same 'strange' metal behavior reported in previous studies (i.e., a linear-in-T resistivity with a Planckian scattering rate). However, the team's study shows that this behavior extends to temperatures far below the Bloch-Grüneisen temperature while the system has a finite Fermi temperature. Moreover, their findings highlight an additional signature of strange metallicity, namely an enhanced linear magnetoresistance.\n\"Perhaps the most interesting part of this study, however, is the recovery of the archetypal behavior of a disordered dilute & correlated metal, the Fermi liquid behavior, away from the superconducting dome,\" Jaoui said. \"This evolution suggests that fluctuations of a yet-to-be-determined nature dominate the metallic ground state in the vicinity of the superconducting dome and drive the low-temperature linear resistivity.\"\nOverall, the findings gathered by this team of researchers suggest that quantum fluctuations and superconductivity in MATBG might be related. In the future, their work could inspire new studies examining this possibility and the quantum-critical phase observed in this study further.\n\"We are now investigating the evolution of the metallic ground state as a function of the 'twist-angle' of twisted bilayer graphene,\" Jaoui added. \"This is, in a very simplistic manner, a knob tuning the strength of the electronic correlations. We will soon publish further report on the metallic ground state of twisted bilayer graphene.\"\n",

Responsible for measuring things like infrared and ultraviolet light, greenhouse gases, atomic clocks, and disease, optical frequency combs act as rulers that measure light. By combing through light, or frequencies, this technology can focus on specific frequencies that researchers can separate and study in limitless situations. \nThese important and powerful combs are made up of hundreds of individual comb lines that are coherent with each other. Traditionally demonstrated in optical fibers or nonlinear crystals, a research team in Carnegie Mellon University's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering has recently demonstrated a chip-scale broadband light source in silicon carbide, which has been traditionally used as an abrasive or for electronic devices that operate at high temperatures or high voltages.\nThe team, led by Qing Li, assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering, used the advanced facilities in the Claire & John Bertucci Nanotechnology Laboratory to create miniaturized optical devices that are less than 0.1 mm in size, approximately the equivalent to the thickness of one sheet of paper.\nSilicon carbide recently emerged as a promising candidate due to its unique properties, including possessing strong second- and third-order nonlinear coefficients and hosting various color centers that can be utilized for a wealth of quantum applications.\n\"The fabrication process has been carefully optimized to define tiny ring-type structures with smooth surfaces,\" states Li. \"Light confined in these so-called microrings experiences significant power enhancement due to the resonance effect, which is strong enough to induce an optical nonlinear response called the Kerr effect.\"\nAs a result, with an input laser being a single wavelength near 1550 nm, the output light consists of multiple wavelengths spanning 1150 nm to 2400nm. Because the composite frequency lines are discrete and equally spaced, this special type of light is termed as an optical comb. \nIn the past decade, miniaturizing the optical comb technology using chip-scale device platforms attracted a lot of research efforts, which can significantly reduce its size, weight, and power consumption, all of which are critically important for its broader adoption in practical applications. In the United States, funding agencies such as DARPA played a key role in driving this direction.\n\"This work is the first demonstration of such wideband combs in silicon carbide, proving its competitiveness as an efficient nonlinear material against more commons choices such as silicon and silicon nitride,\" explained Li. \"Our goal is to develop a series of device technologies, including frequency generation, modulation and conversion, and combine them with the quantum technologies implemented in the silicon carbide platform in a seamless fashion.\"\nThis will eventually lead to powerful information processors that can handle classical and quantum information simultaneously, all based on silicon carbide.\nThe research work was carried out by postdoctoral researcher Dr. Lutong Cai, and graduate students Jingwei Li and Ruixuan Wang.

Ultimately, such methods could significantly aid the design, prediction, analysis and control of complex physical systems.\nSo far, traditional methods based on linear theory achieved poor performances when reconstructing global fields for complex physical systems or processes, particularly when only a limited amount of sensor data is available or when sensors are randomly positioned. In recent years, computer scientists have thus been exploring the potential of alternative methods for global field reconstruction, including deep learning models.\nResearchers at Keio University in Japan, University of California- Los Angeles and other institutes in the U.S. have recently developed a new deep learning tool that can accurately reconstruct global fields without the need for extensive and highly organized sensor data. This method, introduced in a paper published in Nature Machine Intelligence, could open new interesting possibilities for several areas of research, including geophysics, astrophysics and atmospheric science.\n\"Achieving accurate and robust global situational awareness of a complex time-evolving field from a limited number of sensors has been a long-standing challenge,\" Kai Fukami and his colleagues wrote in their paper. \"This reconstruction problem is especially difficult when sensors are sparsely positioned in a seemingly random or unorganized manner, which is often encountered in a range of scientific and engineering problems.\"\nWhen studying atmospheric phenomena, astrophysical processes and other complex physical systems, researchers often only have access to data collected by a limited number of sensors positioned in unorganized ways. In some instances, these sensors can also be moving and may go offline for some periods of time.\nThis lack of ideal sensor data has so far made it difficult to reconstruct global fields for these complex systems. While deep learning techniques have achieved some promising results, implementing them can often be highly expensive and computationally demanding.\nThe global field reconstruction technique developed by Fukami and his colleagues merges deep learning with Voronoi tessellation, a way of representing and describing biological structures or physical systems. In the past, Voronoi tessellations or diagrams have been used in many areas of science and engineering.\n\"We propose a data-driven spatial field recovery technique founded on a structured grid-based deep-learning approach for arbitrary positioned sensors of any numbers,\" Kai Fukami and his colleagues explained in their paper. \"We consider the use of Voronoi tessellation to obtain a structured-grid representation from sensor locations, enabling the computationally tractable use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs).\"\nThe technique created by the researchers incorporates the data collected by sparse sensors into a CNN, approximating local information onto a structured representation, while retaining data related to the location of sensors. To do this, it constructs a Voronoi tessellation of the unstructured dataset and then adds the input data field corresponding to the location of the sensors, implementing it as a mask.\nTwo advantageous features of this method for global field reconstruction are that it is compatible with deep learning-based techniques that have proved promising for advanced image processing and it can also be implemented with an arbitrary number of sensors. So far, the researchers demonstrated the effectiveness of their approach by using it to reconstruct global fields using three different sets of sensor data, namely unsteady wake flow, geophysical data and 3D turbulence data.\nIn contrast with previously proposed methods, the tool developed by Fukami and his colleagues also works with data collected by a random number of moving sensors. In the future, it could thus have many valuable applications, enabling global field estimation for different physical systems in real-time, even in instances where sensors are positioned in unorganized ways.\n",

The key was to reduce the magnitude of the voltage applied to the device to increase the switching efficiency of a semiconductor device.\nThe research team succeeded in increasing the switching efficiency of the device by using platinum nanoparticles.

The next-generation engine will build on much of the architectural and materials technology demonstrated during AETP, but will be sized differently to the 40,000 lb.-thrust-class XA100 that was designed to fit the Lockheed Martin F-35.\nIn August GE’s NGAD prototype engine work was awarded test and developments contracts under the Next Generation Adaptive Propulsion （NGAP）engine program. Pratt & Whitney, which is currently testing its own XA101 adaptive engine under AETP, was also awarded an NGAP test and development contract. Propulsion integration-related NGAP contracts were also issued to airframers Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman.\nTests of the GE XA100 showed the design is a “flight-weight, highly product-relevant engine that would provide the F-35 with 30% more range, greater than 20% faster acceleration, and significant mission systems growth to harness the F-35’s full capabilities for Block 4 upgrades, and beyond,” says David Tweedie, GE Edison Works’ vice president and general manager for Advanced Products.\nFollowing an initial contract award in 2016, GE ran the first of two XA100 demonstrators at the company’s facility in Evendale, Ohio, in August 2021. The second test engine began runs at AEDC in March 2022. The engine design modulates airflow via an adaptive fan to provide either a high-thrust mode for combat power or a low-fuel-burn mode for longer range and loiter time. The additional bypass airflow, described as a third-stream, also passes through heat exchangers to provide increased thermal management capability.\nGE says the first XA100 “is in the process of disassembly and evaluation which is a standard process to validate the design of any new engine. The second engine has been transported back from AEDC to Evendale, and GE is working closely with [the Air Force] Life Cycle Management Center to determine what level of evaluation would be beneficial to the program.”\nCompletion of tests at AEDC, meanwhile, comes as the Defense Department weighs whether to launch a re-engining effort for the F-35 based on one of the AETP engines. Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall says a decision could possibly be made as part of the fiscal 2024 budget but has cautioned that the price tag of developing and installing an adaptive engine could run to $6 billion. GE’s Tweedie adds the company “now stands ready to transition to an Engineering and Manufacturing Development program and bring this engine to the field with the F-35 before the end of this decade.”\n",

On July 27, the university and research foundation announced plans for the construction of the 65,000-squre-footHypersonic Applied Research Facility. That facility will house the only Mach 8 quiet wind tunnel in the world as well as a hypersonic pulse (HYPULSE) shock tunnel. On Aug. 2, it was announced thatRolls-Royce will significantly expand its already large footprintat Purdue. Its new test facilities will be used to develop high-altitude and hybrid-electric engines to power the next generation of U.S. military aircraft.\n“At Purdue, we’re committed to research at the very frontiers of science, especially when it can contribute to the national security of Americans,” Purdue President Mitch Daniels said. “Becoming home to the nation’s premier hypersonics facilities can make such a contribution, while providing enormous new opportunities for our researchers, aspiring entrepreneurs, and job seeking graduates.”\nMark J. Lewis, executive director of the Emerging Technology Institute, a nonpartisan think tank focused on technology critical to the future of national defense, and the chief scientific advisor to NineTwelve, said, “We need to do more than match our peer competitors, we need to leapfrog them quickly.This facility will help us make that happen.”\nThe HGTC will be administered by a new nonprofit consortium of national defense industry partners that will manage capital and operational costs. Rolls-Royce North America is the first aerospace industry member of the HGTC consortium. Other national industry partners and potential interested government entities are being recruited.\nThe HGTC facility will house two separate testing streams; partners can conduct tests in the 3.5-5.0 Mach range or the 4.5-7.5 Mach range. Multiple companies can undertake work simultaneously on site, while being ensured full protection of intellectual property and sensitive work. These facilities will be available for long-term lease to allow guaranteed, timely access for contractors to conduct tests at their preferred schedule and duration.\nTom Bell, chairman and CEO, Rolls-Royce North America, said, “Rolls-Royce is proud to be the founding member of this significant new addition to aerospace research. We credit leadership from the state of Indiana, Purdue University and Purdue Research Foundation for their important vision and investment leading to the creation of the Hypersonics Ground Test Center. Rolls-Royce has a unique history in high-speed propulsion, dating to the Concorde aircraft and 30 years of experience on hypersonics research with our Department of Defense customers through our LibertyWorks advanced technology unit in Indianapolis. We are keenly interested in the area of hypersonic propulsion and currently exploring development of advanced supersonic and high-Mach propulsion systems with our customers.”\nIndiana Gov. Eric Holcomb said the HGTC is another example of how the state of Indiana and industry succeed together.\n\"Creating this first-in-the-nation center is possible because we have industry partners that aren't just on the cutting edge but are reinventing where the edge is,” Holcomb said. “Couple that with the many thriving communities in Tippecanoe County, and a gushing pipeline of top talent at Purdue including researchers, students and graduates prepared to make the next giant leaps in both aerospace and hypersonic innovation. It's because of days like today that our economy remains strong and Indiana reigns as one of the best places in the world to do business.\"\nU.S. Sen. Todd Young of Indiana, said, “The transformational technologies being developed and tested at Purdue will help America win the 21stcentury. Not only will these ideas create the jobs of tomorrow, they will ensure that the American military remains the strongest and most advanced fighting force in the world.”\nPurdue University and Purdue Research Foundation will fund the construction of the HGTC.\nPRF president and CEO Brian Edelman said, \"Building the Hypersonic Ground Test Center would not be possible without a recent multimillion-dollar investment to further expand facilities in the Purdue Aerospace District. That investment from Rolls-Royce, the university and PRF, along with support from the state, West Lafayette, Lafayette and Tippecanoe County, laid the foundation for creating the HGTC.\"\nThe HGTC draft design, capabilities and requirements were developed by Zionsville, Indiana-based NineTwelve, in coordination with PRF. Chad Pittman, president of NineTwelve, said he and the NineTwelve team are excited to be a valuable resources for the facility and the partnerships it has and will continue to attract in the vital space of the nation’s defense needs.”\n",

        "input": "WASHINGTON: Frustrated industry officials, scientists and experts are pushing the US government to take on responsibility for cleaning up the space environment — starting withdebriscreated by federal agencies, some of which dates back to the early days of the Space Age.\n“One of the most important things that the government could do is that 28% of the debris in Low Earth Orbit was created by the US government. A lot of this was, you know, part of winning the Cold War. And like many other environmental messes that were made in winning the Cold War, this one should be cleaned up too,” Jonathan Goff, vice president of on-orbit servicing at exploration startup Voyager Space Holdings, said Thursday during a town-hall-style virtual meeting on space debris sponsored by the White HouseOffice of Science and Technology Policy.\n“If the US Navy had a derelict ship sitting in sovereign waters creating a safety hazard, the Navy would go out and grab that ship… or it would more likely hire a salvage company … and go ahead and bring that ship back to shore,” Doug Loverro, former head of Pentagon space policy during the Obama administration, told the meeting. “That that kind of responsibility has been around for seafaring nations for decades. And I’m not sure why we don’t see the same responsibility in government for their derelict ships and their derelict bodies that are in space today.”\nTaking responsibility, a number of participants said, includes providing more federal government funding for further development and on-orbit demonstration of emerging tech to help kickstart the market and improve the business case for wary investors.\n“If the government would take responsibility for that and would say that they are going to pay for folks to go ahead and get rid of those derelict ships and those derelict [rocket] bodies, many of the business aspects of this that we’ve spoken about would be clear,” Loverro added.\nSeveral participants pointed to the Defense Department’s efforts to spur tech innovation in the field of so-calledactive debris removalvia itsSpaceWERX innovation hubthrough the use of funding authorities such as Small Business Innovation Research/Small Business Technology Transfer grants as a model for other agencies, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and NASA, to emulate.\nHowever, it’s not just funding that is required to handle the burgeoning debris problem, participants said, but also the establishment of an agency focal point or an interagency group to coordinate cross-government action.\n“It’s no longer an option to hide from the problem or punt it down the road. Active management of the space environment requires our immediate attention, and the role of the government should be to display leadership in supporting the development — not just the technologies, also financial incentives and the policy underpinnings — to allow remediation services to thrive,” said Charity Weeden, vice president for global space policy and government relations at debris removal startup Astroscale.\n“Remediation is an interagency issue,” she added. “So there needs to be a top-level coordinator [who] can take into account the aspects of all the departments agencies that would be involved. We think NASA is the right place initially, we’re open for other options and debate on this.”\nThe two-hour “listening session” provided industry reps, scientists and interested members of the public with an opportunity to weigh in on the White House’s “National Orbital Debris Research and Development Plan” [PDF] issued last January in the waning days of the Trump administration.\nIn early November, the Biden administrationannouncedthat OSTP would be updating the plan, which had been criticized by a number of experts as simply touting more research on already widely understood problems, and opened a public comment period through the end of the year. The request specifically asked for input on “what R&D areas are priorities for government-sponsored initiatives/coordination, the roles of academia, nonprofit, and industry actors in addressing these actions, and potential avenues for coordination between actors across public and private sectors.”\nTo follow up, on Dec. 17 OSTP announced [PDF] that it would hold two town-hall type virtual opportunities for oral comments as follows:\n·Jan. 13, Debris Mediation:“the active or passive manipulation of debris objects to reduce or eliminate the risk they pose to operational space assets. This may include fully removing debris from orbit, moving debris from orbits that pose a high risk to operational spacecraft into lower-risk orbits, and finding ways to repurpose or recycle existing debris.”\n·Jan. 20, Debris Mitigation:which refers to “limiting the creation of new debris through deliberate spacecraft and launch vehicle design choices.”\nThe Thursday meeting at times resembled the TV comedy Seinfeld’s Festivus celebration’s “airing of grievances,” and at other times descended into what could only be seen as shameless self-promotion of various tech companies’ wares. That said, there was widespread accord on a number of recommendations.\nFor example, aside from the issues of responsibility and funding, numerous commenters noted the need to lower the 25-year time deadline for removing defunct satellites from LEO — which the Trump administration’s2019 rewrite of US space debris mitigation guidelinesretained after a fierce inter-agency fight.\nAnother common thread was on the need for the Commerce Department to quit stalling on providing NOAA’sOffice of Space Commerceadequate funding and more authority to take on the role of civil space traffic management, relieving the Defense Department of the job of warning commercial and non-US operators of potential on-orbit collisions, including with debris.\nIndeed, President Joe Biden’s nominee for DoD assistant secretary of space policy, John Plumb,in his confirmation hearing Thursday,called space traffic management “absolutely essential” and pledged to help make the transfer of responsibility happen.\n",

To this end, a Multinational Field Trial Exercise was held on 23/24 March at the land test centre of the Italian Armed Forces (Centro Polifunzionale di Sperimentazione) in Montelibretti near Rome.\nMore than 30 experts from military test centres based in Italy, Sweden, Greece, Spain, the Netherlands, France and Portugal participated in the exercise co-organised by EDA and the Italian MoD. The first part of the event took place outdoor, in the wider area of the test centre, and was aimed at acquiring images with several cameras working in different spectral regions (visible, longwave Infrared, short wave Infrared) under diverse configurations (mounted on a drone or grounded).\nA large number of pictures of different terrain landscapes were taken, with and without a specific target. During the second part of the exercise, all these images were uploaded onto the prototypic software platform of the future European Terrain Database which will be installed on EDA servers in the coming months, ready to be populated by users from different participating Member States with unclassified images in different spectral regions (visible, Infrared wavelengths and microwave). The stored pictures will also include information and metadata deemed necessary or useful for their military usage in test and/or research activities.\nOnce established and fully accessible, the database can be used, for instance, for target recognition, the assessment and improvement of camouflage effectiveness, the testing and enhancement of sensors in different terrains, the generation of synthetic images or the support of modelling and simulation activities.\nThe exercise participants came from different expert communities with an interest in the ETDB, particularly scientists and technicians specialised in Optronics and Radar sensor design (including materials) and performance prediction, design, development and testing of new camouflage, visible and infrared signature and Radar Cross Section mitigation solutions. The future dataset can be employed by the Ministries of Defence of all participating Member States for R&T initiatives as well as for operational and training purposes. The multinational field trial was therefore an excellent opportunity for those experts to meet and explore potential cooperation opportunities among European defence test centres.\nThe event was organised in the framework of EDA’s Defence Test & Evaluation Base (DTEB) initiative, which was launched in 2010 to collect, share and harmonise defence test & evaluation standards and procedures at European level. In the meantime, the DTEB has developed into a dynamic and useful network, not only of European Military Test Centres, but also of companies, universities and public/private research centres operating in the sector of defence technologies.\n",

TRISO fuel particles - each less than a millimetre in diameter - contain a kernel of enriched uranium oxycarbide surrounded by layers of carbon and silicon carbide, giving a containment for fission products which is stable to over 1600°C. It has been described as the most robust nuclear fuel in the world.\n\"This award is an important step in creating commercial-scale advanced fuel production in the UK at our Springfields facility for the reactors of tomorrow,\" said Westinghouse President and CEO Patrick Fragman. \"We look forward to partnering with Urenco for their global leadership in enrichment, in support of UK energy security and net-zero carbon goals. We also welcome the support of TRISO-X and their valuable experience in the fabrication of advanced TRISO fuels.\"\nUrenco CEO Boris Schucht added: \"Security of energy supply and realising crucial climate change goals requires the evolution of the nuclear fuel cycle. This includes a focus on producing the next generation of fuels. Urenco is committed to this development and is pleased to be collaborating with the UK nuclear industry and government to achieve an enhanced service for global utilities and wider benefits for society.\"\n\"The deployment of next generation TRISO fuel manufacturing in Springfields is an important step toward the UK's decarbonisation and energy independence goals,\" said TRISO-X President Pete Pappano. \"TRISO-X is pleased to bring our state-of-the-art process knowledge to support this grant.\"\nEarlier this month, TRISO-X broke ground for North America's first commercial-scale advanced nuclear fuel facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The TRISO-X Fuel Fabrication Facility - or TF3 - is set to be commissioned and operational by 2025. It will initially produce 8 tonnes of fuel per year, supporting about 16 advanced reactors, and is envisaged to increase to 16 tonnes per year by the early 2030s.\nOn 2 September this year, the UK government announced GBP3.3 million (USD3.8 million) in funding to support the development of advanced nuclear technology. The funding through the Advanced Modular Reactor Research, Development and Demonstration programme - part of the GBP385 million Advanced Nuclear Fund - will support the development of innovative nuclear technology in the UK, such as HTGRs. It aims to demonstrate HTGR technology by the early 2030s.\nUnder that funding, Springfields Fuels Ltd is receiving GBP243,311 for a project, in collaboration with Urenco, to determine the most effective route for the secure and reliable supply of coated particle fuel (CPF) to support the range of potential HTGR technologies which may come forward in the UK. The study will focus on UCO?-kernel TRISO as the standard CPF fuel type for contemporary HTGR designs but will design the facility for maximum flexibility to manufacture a wide range of variations on this fuel.\n",

KIZILELMA means “red apple” in Turkish, but refers to an expression in Turkish mythology that symbolizes goals, ideas, or dreams that are far away, but whose attraction is greater the further away they are.\nSelcuk Bayraktar, Baykar’s Chief Technology Officer, also posted the photographs and noted that his company launched another brand-new product three and a half years after beginning manufacturing of Akinci UCAV.\nWith the 5th generation fighters, the world is witnessing the end of manned fighters. No new manned combat aircraft will be developed. Unmanned systems will increasingly become the strongest elements on the battlefield in the future. We are also trying to ensure our country’s presence in future competitions.”\nAs Naval News previously reported, Baykar unveiled the MIUS project on June 20, 2021. The announcement came along with several surprising renderings showing the future Turkish TCG Anadolu helicopter landing dock. This was an unexpected development, as Baykar is reportedly working on the TB3 Bayraktar UCAV to be deployed aboard TCG Anadolu, and MIUS will be a second option for aircraft operations.\nAfter being removed from the F35 JSF project, the Turkish government decided to transform the future TCG Anadolu into a carrier ship for attack drones. In a March interview, SSB Head Ismail Demir stated that after the project is completed, between 30 and 50 folding-winged Bayraktar TB3 drones will be sent to Anadolu. After seven months, he disclosed in a TV interview that LHD Anadolu will house up to 80 drones.\nConsidering a future in which air combat will be dominated by unmanned technology, the “BAYRAKTAR KIZILELMA” developed entirely within Turkish borders will certainly play an increasingly important role in the future.\nAccording to the information provided by the company, the BAYRAKTAR KIZILELMA will be a force to be reckoned with, primarily due to its aggressive maneuverability and stealth capability against radar. In addition, the BAYRAKTAR KIZILELMA will be able to take off and land on aircraft carriers with short runways and conduct missions with internally carried munitions.\nThe first BAYRAKTAR KIZILELMA prototype will use a turbofan to fly at Mach 0.8 near the speed of sound; later prototypes will fly at supersonic speeds. A SATCOM antenna will enable autonomous control via satellite, and MIUS can remain airborne for up to 5 hours. The unmanned jet will have 6 tons of takeoff weight and up to 1500 kg payload capacity.\nBaykar Defense and Ukraine’s Ivchenko-Progress signed a contract for Bayraktar KIZILELMA to supply AI-322F turbofan engines for the unmanned jet during the Defense, Aerospace, and Defense Exhibition SAHA EXPO 2021, which was held in Istanbul from Nov. 10-13, 2021.\nBayraktar KIZILELMA will be equipped with an AESA radar developed by Turkey’s leading defence company Aselsan and will be capable of launching indigenous Bozdogan and Gokdogan air-to-air missiles. The future unmanned jet will be armed with SOM-J cruise missiles with a range of more than 250 km for surface warfare and Roketsan-made MAM family guided munitions for small strike operations.\nBAYRAKTAR KIZILELMA’s maiden flight is scheduled for the end of 2023.\nSource: naval newsDate:Mar 13, 2022\n",

        "input": "When materials are cooled down to extremely low temperatures, their behavior often differs strongly from that at room temperature. A well-known example is superconductivity: below a critical temperature some metals and other substances conduct electric current without any losses. At even lower temperatures additional quantum-physical effects can occur, which are relevant for basic research as well as for applications in quantum technologies.\nHowever, to reach such temperatures—less than a thousandth of a degree above the absolute zero of 0 Kelvin, or -273.15 degrees Celsius—is exceedingly difficult. Physicists in the research group of Prof. Dr. Dominik Zumbühl at the University of Basel, together with colleagues at the VTT Technical Research Centre in Finland and at Lancaster University in England, have now set a new low-temperature record. Their results have just been published in Physical Review Research.\nCooling with magnetic fields\n\"Cooling a material down very strongly is not the only problem,\" explains Christian Scheller, a senior scientist in Zumbühl's laboratory. \"One also has to reliably measure those extremely low temperatures.\"\nIn their experiments, the researchers cooled a tiny electric circuit made of copper on a silicon chip by first exposing it to a strong magnetic field, then cooling it with a special fridge known as a cryostat and eventually ramping down the magnetic field slowly. In this way, the nuclear spins of the copper atoms in the chip were initially aligned like small magnets and effectively cooled down even further when, at the end, ramping down the magnetic field led to a decrease in their magnetic energy.\n\"We've been working with such techniques for a decade now, but so far the lowest temperatures that could be reached in this way were limited by the vibrations of the fridge,\" says Omid Sharifi Sedeh, who was involved in the experiments as a Ph.D. student.\nThose vibrations, which arise from the continuous compression and rarefaction of the cooling agent helium in a so-called \"dry\" cryostat, significantly heat up the chip. To avoid that, the researchers developed a new sample holder that is wired so strongly that the chip can be cooled to very low temperatures despite the vibrations.\nRobust thermometer\nTo accurately measure those temperatures, Zumbühl and his collaborators improved a special thermometer that is integrated into the circuit. The thermometer consists of copper islands that are connected by so-called tunnel junctions. Electrons can move through those junctions more or less easily depending on the temperature.\nThe physicists found a method to make the thermometer more robust against material defects and, at the same time, more temperature-sensitive. This allowed them, finally, to measure a temperature of just 220 millionths of a degree above absolute zero (220 micro Kelvin).\nIn the future, the Basel researchers want to use their method to lower the temperature by another factor of ten and, in the long run, also cool semiconductor materials. That will pave the way towards studies of new quantum effects and diverse applications, such as the optimization of qubits in quantum computers.\n",

It is expected to become the world’s most powerful rocket-ship. “Starship was designed from the onset to be able to carry more than 100 tons of cargo to Mars and the Moon. The cargo version can also be used for rapid point-to-point Earth transport. Various payload bay configurations are available and allow for fully autonomous deployment of cargo to Earth, Lunar, or Martian surfaces,” the company said.\nSpaceX’s Starship launch vehicle has many potential uses and capabilities that will enable access to space like never before. The cargo version of Starship will be able to launch entire satellite constellations in a single launch inside its payload bay. For perspective, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 can carry up to 60 Starlink satellites in a tight configuration inside its 5.2-meter diameter fairing, Starship will be able to carry 400 Starlink satellites to deploy in a single launch inside its fairing. Starship will be capable of deploying giant spacecraft to space inside its clamshell-like fairing, which has an outer diameter of 9-meters –“the largest usable payload volume of any current or in development launcher,” the company says. SpaceX also plans to design an extended Starship volume capability for payloads requiring up to 22-meters of height.\nStarship will also be able to capture satellites already in orbit to be repaired or brought back to be disposed of on Earth, according to SpaceX’s Starship User Guide. “Fully-reusable Starship and Super Heavy systems are expected to allow for space-based activities that have not been possible since the retirement of the Space Shuttle and Space Transportation System, or have never been possible before. With a fully reusable Starship, satellites can be captured and repaired in Orbit, returned to Earth, or transferred to a new operational orbit,” SpaceX’s vehicle guide says. This will be possible with Starship’s large clamshell-like cargo door mechanism that opens and closes, as shown in the image below. The clamshell door can be modified to “chomp up” old satellites and space junk orbiting Earth. “We can fly Starship around space and chomp up debris with the moving fairing door,” SpaceX founder Elon Musk said in July 2021.\nThis clamshell-like fairing could enable engineers to develop a mechanism to gather satellites to repair, as well as pick up other orbiting objects that are no longer in use. SpaceX President and Chief Operating Officer Gwynne Shotwell says Starship could help clean up space. “Starship is an extraordinary new vehicle capability… Not only will it decrease the costs of access to space, it’s the vehicle that would transport people from Earth to Mars,” Shotwell said last year, “But it also has the capability of taking cargo and crew at the same time, and so it’s quite possible that we could leverage Starship to go to some of these dead rocket bodies — other people’s rocket’s, of course. Basically pick up some of this junk in outer space,” she said. “There are rocket bodies littering the space environment, and dead satellites littering the space environment. […] It’s not easy. It’s not going to be easy but I do believe that Starship offers the possibility of going and doing that and I’m really excited about it,” Shotwell said. As of today, there’s approximately 4,500 active satellites orbiting Earth operated by multiple organizations, businesses, and government agencies from around the world.There are 3,170 inactive dead satellites and around 35,000 debris objects - 70% of which are in low Earth orbit. All orbiting objects are tracked by the U.S. Space Command.SpaceX Starship could provide the world a unique opportunityto clean up outer space by bringing back defunct objects.\n",

        "input": "Compared with computers, the human brain is incredibly energy-efficient. Scientists are therefore drawing on how the brain and its interconnected neurons function for inspiration in designing innovative computing technologies. They foresee that these brain-inspired computing systems, will be more energy-efficient than conventional ones, as well as better at performing machine-learning tasks.\nMuch like neurons, which are responsible for both data storage and data processing in the brain, scientists want to combine storage and processing in a single type of electronic component, known as a memristor. Their hope is that this will help to achieve greater efficiency because moving data between the processor and the storage, as conventional computers do, is the main reason for the high energy consumption in machine-learning applications.\nResearchers at ETH Zurich, Empa and the University of Zurich have now developed an innovative concept for a memristor that can be used in a far wider range of applications than existing memristors. \"There are different operation modes for memristors, and it is advantageous to be able to use all these modes depending on an artificial neural network's architecture,\" explains ETH Zurich postdoc Rohit John. \"But previous conventional memristors had to be configured for one of these modes in advance.\" The new memristors can now easily switch between two operation modes while in use: a mode in which the signal grows weaker over time and dies (volatile mode), and one in which the signal remains constant (non-volatile mode).\nJust like in the brain\n\"These two operation modes are also found in the human brain,\" John says. On the one hand, stimuli at the synapses are transmitted from neuron to neuron with biochemical neurotransmitters. These stimuli start out strong and then gradually become weaker. On the other hand, new synaptic connections to other neurons form in the brain while we learn. These connections are longer-lasting.\nJohn, who is a postdoc in the group headed by ETH Zurich/Empa researcher Maksym Kovalenko, was awarded an ETH fellowship for outstanding postdoctoral researchers in 2020. John conducted this research together with Yi?it Demira?, a doctoral student in Giacomo Indiveri's group at the Institute for Neuroinformatics of the University of Zurich and ETH Zurich.\nSemiconductor material known from solar cells\nThe memristors the researchers have developed are made of halide perovskite nanocrystals, a semiconductor material known primarily from its use in photovoltaic cells. \"The 'nerve conduction' in these new memristors is mediated by temporarily or permanently stringing together silver ions from an electrode to form a nanofilament penetrating the perovskite structure through which current can flow,\" explains Kovalenko.\nThis process can be regulated to make the silver-ion filament either thin, so that it gradually breaks back down into individual silver ions (volatile mode), or thick and permanent (non-volatile mode). This is controlled by the intensity of the current conducted on the memristor: Applying a weak current activates the volatile mode, while a strong current activates the non-volatile mode.\nNew toolkit for neuroinformaticians\n\"To our knowledge, this is the first memristor that can be reliably switched between volatile and non-volatile modes on demand,\" Demira? says. This means that in the future, computer chips can be manufactured with memristors that enable both modes. This is a significance advance because it is usually not possible to combine several different types of memristors on one chip.\nWithin the scope of the study, which they recently published in the journal Nature Communications, the researchers tested 25 of these new memristors and carried out 20,000 measurements with them. In this way, they were able to simulate a computational problem on a complex network. The problem involved classifying a number of different neuron spikes as one of four predefined patterns.\nBefore these memristors can be used in computer technology, they will need to undergo further optimization. However, such components are also important for research in neuroinformatics, as Indiveri points out: \"These components come closer to real neurons than previous ones. As a result, they help researchers to better test hypotheses in neuroinformatics and hopefully gain a better understanding of the computing principles of real neuronal circuits in humans and animals.\"\n",
        "output": "近日，瑞士苏黎世联邦理工学院的研究人员开发出一种新型忆阻器。在传统计算机中，处理器和存储器之间的数据传输过程的电能消耗是机器学习应用程序高能耗的主要原因，而忆阻器正好有望解决这一难题。因为它可以像神经元一样既负责数据存储又负责数据处理，避免了传输消耗。为此，研究人员使用卤化物钙钛矿纳米晶体制成了一种比现有忆阻器应用更为广泛的新型忆阻器,传统忆阻器必须事先配置好工作模式，而新忆阻器可以在使用时轻松在易失性模式和非易失性模式之间切换。这意味着未来计算机芯片可以用支持这两种模式的忆阻器来制造。该研究成果也将有望应用于神经信息学领域，以帮助研究人员更好地理解人类和动物真实神经元回路的计算原理。"

        "input": "SAN DIEGO – 11 January 2023 – General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc. (GA-ASI) further advanced its Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) ecosystem by flying three unique missions with artificially intelligent (AI) pilots on an operationally relevant Open Mission System (OMS) software stack. A company-owned Avenger? Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) was paired with “digital twin” aircraft to autonomously conduct Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) multi-objective collaborative combat missions. The flights, which took place on Dec. 14, 2022, from GA-ASI’s Desert Horizons flight operations facility in El Mirage, Calif., demonstrate the company’s commitment to maturing its CCA ecosystem for Autonomous Collaborative Platform (ACP) UAS using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). This provides a new and innovative tool for next-generation military platforms to make decisions under dynamic and uncertain real-world conditions.\nThe flight used GA-ASI’s novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) architecture built using agile software development methodology and industry-standard tools such as Docker and Kubernetes to develop and validate three deep learning RL algorithms in an operationally relevant environment. RL agents demonstrated single, multi, and hierarchical agent behaviors. The single agent RL model successfully navigated the live plane while dynamically avoiding threats to accomplish its mission. Multi-agent RL models flew a live and virtual Avenger to collaboratively chase a target while avoiding threats. The hierarchical RL agent used sensor information to select courses of action based on its understanding of the world state. This demonstrated the AI pilot’s ability to successfully process and act on live real-time information independently of a human operator to make mission-critical decisions at the speed of relevance.\nFor the missions, real-time updates were made to flight paths based on fused sensor tracks provided by virtual Advanced Framework for Simulation, Integration, and Modeling (AFSIM) models, and RL agent missions were dynamically selected by operators while the plane was airborne, demonstrating live, effective human-machine teaming for autonomy. This live operational data describing AI pilot performance will be fed into GA-ASI’s rapid retraining process for analysis and used to refine future agent performance.\n“The concepts demonstrated by these flights set the standard for operationally relevant mission systems capabilities on CCA platforms,” said GA-ASI Senior Director of Advanced Programs Michael Atwood. “The combination of airborne high-performance computing, sensor fusion, human-machine teaming, and AI pilots making decisions at the speed of relevance shows how quickly GA-ASI’s capabilities are maturing as we move to operationalize autonomy for CCAs.”\nThe team used a government-furnished Collaborative Operations in Denied Environment (CODE) autonomy engine and the government-standard OMS messaging protocol to enable communication between the RL agents and the LVC system. Utilizing government standards such as OMS will make rapid integration of autonomy for CCAs possible.\nIn addition, GA-ASI used a General Dynamics Mission Systems’ EMC2 to run the autonomy architecture. EMC2 is an open architecture Multi-Function Processor with multi-level security infrastructure that is used to host the autonomy architecture, demonstrating the ability to bring high-performance computing resources to CCAs to perform quickly tailorable mission sets depending on the operational environment.\nThis is another in an ongoing series of autonomous flights performed using internal research and development funding to prove out important AI/ML concepts for UAS.\n",

        "input": "FlyZero, the UK study into zero-carbon emission commercial air travel, has published its vision for a new generation of aircraft powered by liquid hydrogen, today Thursday 17th March.\nThe report “Our Vision for Zero-Carbon Emission Air Travel” marks the conclusion of a 12-month study which set out to consider the feasibility of zero-carbon emission aircraft. The project concludes aviation can achieve net zero 2050 through the development of both sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and green liquid hydrogen technologies.\nTo secure market share on new hydrogen-powered aircraft, UK companies must be ready to demonstrate technologies by 2025. This timescale is key for new zero-carbon emission aircraft to enter service by 2035 and to achieve the net zero 2050 target.\nLed by the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI) and backed by the UK government, FlyZero has concluded that green liquid hydrogen is the optimum fuel for zero-carbon emission flight and could power a midsize aircraft with 280 passengers from London to San Francisco directly, or from London to Auckland with just one stop.\nIntroducing a midsize hydrogen-powered aircraft by 2035 and a narrowbody aircraft by 2037 represents the greatest opportunity for reducing carbon emissions and maximising market impact. Aviation’s carbon emissions would reduce by four gigatons (Gt) up to 2050, equivalent to four years’ of total global aviation carbon emissions, if half the commercial fleet were hydrogen-powered by then, and 14 Gt by 2060.\nThe UK can build on decades of expertise in aerospace innovation to propel a new generation of liquid hydrogen-powered aircraft into our skies, working with global OEMs, governments, and regulatory bodies. With targeted investment in technology, the UK could grow its market share in civil aerospace from 12% today to 19% by 2050, increasing the sector’s gross value added to the economy from ?11bn to ?36bn and the number of aerospace jobs from 116,000 to 154,000.\nThe report sets out how aviation can keep businesses, cultures, families and nations connected without the carbon footprint. Realising this presents challenges for all facets of our aerospace and aviation sectors as well as wider industries and energy infrastructure. An integrated, collaborative, international approach to these challenges is needed to protect our planet, maintain the benefits of aviation and secure economic growth.\nIn parallel, the UK must also continue to advance technologies required for sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) as both SAF and liquid hydrogen are needed to achieve the net zero 2050 target.\nChris Gear, project director said: “Zero-carbon emission flight can be a reality. Tackling the challenge of our generation requires accelerated technology development and urgent investment in green energy together with regulatory and infrastructure changes.\n“The next three years are crucial to develop the technologies, build our skills in liquid hydrogen and demonstrate capability here in the UK to enable our aerospace sector and supply chain to secure its role in a new era for aviation.\n“Realising hydrogen powered flight by 2035 is a huge challenge but is essential if we are to maintain the social and economic benefits of air travel while protecting our planet and meeting our commitments to fight climate change.”\nIndustry Minister Lee Rowley said: “Realising zero carbon flight is one of the most ambitious challenges we can contemplate. However, it could also be one of the biggest economic opportunities for the UK’s world leading aerospace sector.\n“It’s great to see FlyZero’s final outputs following a year of intense research, successfully bringing UK industry together to think through how to reduce aviation’s impact on our Earth and sky while ensuring and celebrating the immense benefits of air travel and connecting the world.”.\nThe report published today summarises FlyZero’s findings in a range of key areas:\nTechnology – revolutionary technology breakthroughs are required in six areas to achieve zero-carbon emission flight: hydrogen fuel systems and tanks, hydrogen gas turbines, hydrogen fuel cells, electrical propulsion systems, aerodynamic structures and thermal management. The UK has expertise and capability today in these, but little in liquid hydrogen fuels.\nCarbon emissions – global cumulative CO2 emissions from aviation could be reduced by 4 gigatons (Gt) by 2050 and 14 Gt by 2060. This requires 50% of the commercial fleet to be hydrogen-powered by 2050 and assumes midsize hydrogen-powered aircraft are operating by 2035, with hydrogen-powered narrowbody aircraft in service by 2037.\nNon-CO2 emissions – burning hydrogen in a gas turbine emits no CO2 or SOx but water emissions are over 2.5 times higher than for fossil fuel-powered aircraft. Particulate matter will largely be eliminated, and it is estimated that NOx emissions will be reduced by 50 to 70%.\nSustainability – developing a new generation of aircraft presents an opportunity to integrate sustainability into design and manufacture, and further improve the reuse of materials.\nEconomics – from the mid-2030s liquid hydrogen will be cheaper than the most widely available sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), power-to-liquid.\nMarket impact – the optimum route to decarbonising aviation is through the accelerated introduction into service of a large commercial aircraft similar to FlyZero’s midsize concept which is capable of reaching anywhere in the world with just one stop. Less commercially risky than developing a narrowbody first, this midsize first approach would also allow infrastructure development to be focused on fewer, but larger international hub airports.\nInfrastructure and operations – generating the quantity of hydrogen needed for aviation will require unprecedented renewable energy capacity. Transporting hydrogen to airports will require gaseous pipelines or liquid hydrogen tanker deliveries, while refuelling aircraft will require larger diameter hoses and increased automation to ensure it can take place safely and efficiently alongside other aircraft.\nResearch – the UK requires a hydrogen research and development facility with open access for academia and a range of industries including aerospace, automotive, marine, space and energy.\nClimate science – research into the climate impact of emissions from hydrogen gas turbines including through modelling and testing is fundamental alongside the technology development.\nThe FlyZero project is publishing its detailed conclusions through a series of reports which explore the technology challenges, manufacturing demands, operational requirements, market opportunity and sustainability credentials of zero-carbon emission commercial aircraft. A series of more detailed and technical reports together with new supporting research from industry and academia are also available to organisations that meet the requirements of an access test. For a full list of reports and information on how to access them, visit ati.org.uk/flyzero-reports.\nThe FlyZero project has made some initial conclusions that require further investigation and investment to understand the feasibility and approach to innovation for the next phase. To this end the ATI will incorporate the findings from the project into its forthcoming technology and portfolio strategies and look to pursue opportunities for the UK.\n",
        "output": "英国航空航天技术研究所（ATI）当日宣布其FlyZero项目已完成其为期12个月的初步研究，并发布了一份名为“我们零碳排放航空旅行的愿景（Our Vision for Zero-Carbon Emission Air Travel）”的报告，表明了对新一代液态氢动力飞机的愿景，该研究旨在探索零碳排放飞机的可行性。\nFlyZero项目团队汇集了100名来自空客、罗罗、GKN航空航天、Spirit AeroSystems、通用航空、Reaction Engines、NATS、EasyJet 和 Eaton等多家公司的专家。通过对电池、氢和氨等零碳排放能源进行比较，得出的结论是绿色液氢是最可行的，并且有潜力延伸到使用燃料电池、燃气轮机和混合推进系统的大型飞机，为航空业实现2050年的净零目标，必须投资于可持续航空燃料和绿色液氢技术的发展。为了确保新型氢动力飞机的市场份额，英国公司必须在2025年之前做好技术展示的准备，这对于新型零碳排放飞机在2035年投入使用和实现2050年净零排放的目标至关重要。\n到2035年推出一款中型氢动力飞机，到2037年推出一款窄体飞机，这是减少碳排放和最大化市场影响力的重要机遇。到2050年，航空业的碳排放量将减少40亿吨，相当于全球航空业4年的排放量，如果届时一半的商用飞机使用氢燃料，到2060年将减少140亿吨排放。英国可以利用几十年来在航空航天创新方面的专业知识，与全球航空装备制造商、政府和监管机构合作，推动新一代液氢动力飞机研发及实际应用。通过针对性的技术投资，到2050年，英国在民用航空领域的市场份额将从现在的12%增加到19%，该行业的经济增加值将从110亿英镑增加到360亿英镑，航空工作岗位数量将从11.6万增加到15.4万。技术加速是关键，到2050年工业和航空业只能提供一次机队更新。这为在支线机、窄体机和中型机市场引入零碳排放飞机提供了机会。FlyZero已经对这些概念进行了建模，并确定到2030年设计并驾驶一架由氢气涡轮机驱动的实验性飞机飞越大西洋是可行的。以下总结了FlyZero项目报告中的一系列关键领域发现：\n? 技术——实现零碳排放飞行需要以下六个领域的革命性技术突破：氢燃料系统和储罐、氢燃气涡轮机、氢燃料电池、电力推进系统、空气动力学结构与热管理。几个方面中英国当前在液氢燃料方面专业能力相对薄弱。\n? 碳排放——到2050年，全球航空业二氧化碳累计排放量将减少40亿吨，到2060年减少140亿吨。这需要做到2050年50%的商用飞机采用氢动力，并且需要到2035年中型氢动力飞机投入使用，到2037年氢动力窄体飞机投入使用。\n? 非二氧化碳排放——在燃气轮机中燃烧氢不会产生二氧化碳或硫氧化物，但水的排放量是石化燃料驱动飞机的2.5倍以上。颗粒物将基本消除，预计氮氧化物排放量将减少50~70%。\n? 可持续性——新一代飞机的开发将更加重视设计与制造的可持续性，并进一步改善材料的再利用性。\n? 经济性—— 从21世纪30年代中期开始，液态氢将比最广泛使用的可持续航空燃料成本更低，也更环保。\n? 市场影响——实现航空脱碳的最佳途径是加速引进商用机型（如FlyZero的中型概念飞机），这种飞机可以只经过一站就到达世界任何地方。与先前开发窄体机相比，这种中型飞机的商业风险更小，并且可以将基础设施开发集中在数量少但规模更大的国际枢纽机场上。\n? 基础设施与运营——生产航空业所需的氢量将需要前所未有的可再生能源能力。将氢气运输到机场将需要气体管道或液氢罐车，而加氢设施将需要更大直径的软管、更高的自动化程度，以确保它能与其他飞机一起安全、高效地运行。\n? 研究——英国当前需要一个氢能研究与开发机构，对学术界以及包括航空航天、汽车、海洋、空间与能源在内的一系列行业开放。\n? 气候科学——研究氢气涡轮机排放对气候的影响，进行一系列的建模与测试，这也是该技术发展的基础内容。"

        "input": "Nov. 8, 2022 | ByJohn A. Tirpak\nWargame results and opportunities to asymmetrically counter adversaries are driving the Pentagon’s investment choices in new technologies, said Heidi Shyu, undersecretary of defense for research and engineering. She also said an unclassified document outlining the science and technologies underpinning the new National Defense Strategy will come out in the spring.\nAt a Nov. 3 acquisition-themed event hosted by George Mason University, Shyu said she is choosing to invest in technologies that prove to make a significant difference in the outcomes of large-scale wargames derived from a gaming system developed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Those technologies that don’t have a big impact on the outcome will either be dropped or sent back a few steps for refinement, she said.\nShyu is also looking for asymmetric countermeasures that can offset adversary strengths, about which she didn’t elaborate.\n“Our decisions and investments ought to be driven by exquisite modeling/simulation” at the campaign level, which offers excursions on new capabilities for both the Red and Blue forces, she said.\n“We can literally play it out,” she said. “Let’s go through this battle and see what happens.”\nIf a technology plugged into the game “doesn’t really change the outcome, do I really need this? Should I spend my money somewhere else? Where I can get a bigger bang for the buck?”\nShe said this approach is being taken for a number of new capabilities among her 14 technology priorities. A specific one is looking at many variations of the nuclear command and control system.\n“This is how we get rapid experimentation capabilities proven in a contested environment,” she said. Sometimes, “a great widget works fabulously inside your lab, but when you get it out to the real environment, all the pitfalls show up.”\nThe results of these exercises, along with her office’s notes, are providing insights to help the Joint Staff and regional combatant commanders set their priorities for what they want the R&E enterprise to focus on.\nShyu declined to pick the most important or highest-priority areas under her 14 areas, saying that’s like a parent choosing a favorite child. “They’re all beautiful,” she said.\nThe 14 areas laid out in a February memo from Shyu include ”seed areas” such as biotechnology, future wireless technology, quantum science, and advanced materials. Under “effective adoption areas,” Shyu listed technologies already available in the commercial market which can be integrated into defense systems. These include artificial intelligence and autonomy, human-machine teaming, advanced computing, microelectronics, space technology, renewable energy, and energy storage.\nA third grouping identified as “defense-specific” includes hypersonics, directed-energy weapons, integrated sensing systems, and cyber warfare.\nIn her February memo listing the 14 focus areas, Shyu said she will rapidly protype systems that employ these capabilities and develop “continuous campaigns of Joint experimentation” to refine and deliver the new capabilities.\nShyu said her office will release an “unclassified volume” describing the technology foundations of the National Defense Strategy, “so the public has visibility into these technology areas that are priorities.” Industry may also be able to see a classified version “to give you a little more context about why” certain technologies are priorities and others aren’t, she said. It will contain “a rationale you won’t see in the unclassified” version.\nShyu said she’s anxious to “transition” new technologies into the hands of operators. But “everyone has a different definition of ‘transition,’” she said. The obvious one is when an “advanced prototype” turns into a program of record, but “it could be a piece of software that got into the hands of a warfighter … It could be something dual-use, and we decide to go commercial. That’s a successful transition: We funded it; it went commercial; we’re buying it off the shelf.”\nShyu also said she is making more efficient use of technology funds. New data systems are giving her insight into the technology programs across the breadth of the Pentagon’s science and technology and R&D enterprise at a level of detail not previously available, “and we’re sharing that with industry.” She said she has monthly meetings with small and large companies, looking for feedback on the “pain points” of working the Pentagon S&T enterprise.\nHer shop is also focusing on international engagements, sharing information that can help avoid duplication of effort and yield results that both parties can use. As an example, she cited the SCIFIRE air-breathing hypersonics initiative with Australia, which she said helped the Air Force makes its downselect for the Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile.\n“Every single novel idea was not invented here, right?” Shyu said, adding that she wants to “look wide” at partner and ally technologies, in an application of “integrated deterrence,” to “collaborate together to counter our adversary.” She said she’s created a “SAP umbrella”—meaning special access programs information sharing agreement—“to share more sensitive information” in pursuit of co-development.\nShe noted that President Biden “made the decision to share exquisite [intelligence] data with NATO. That built trust. Because they realized” what the U.S. said it was seeing “all … came true,” and that built trust to work better together.\n“I want to share development with partner nations,” she asserted, naming “Australia, the UK, NATO, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Latvia … Israel, you name it” who “all want to be partners with us, [who are] interested in co-development.”\nShe’s particularly interested in “leap ahead” technologies that can asymmetrically blunt certain threats, which will be important for the “campaigning” aspect of the NDS’s integrated deterrence mantra, Shyu said.\n“Just because you have 1,000 tanks, if I have 1,001, I win … that’s very linear thinking. I want to think about what are the asymmetric ways we can counter the threat,” she said.\nTo that end, she’s setting up a “war room” that will focus all available “intel threat” intelligence, along with the state-of-the-art of technology and the status of technology efforts underway in the DOD, so that “we can get to … the asymmetric things we’re developing, faster.”\n“So that the ‘war room,’ and I want to use that to drive the S&T strategy,” she said. It will look at the enterprise “cohesively. And it’s going to cover underwater to space.”\nShyu said she’s had “a very significant impact on the POM,” or five-year spending plan, and that’s because she has regular engagement with the regional commanders and understand their needs for “what we need to be ready in the 10-20-30 year timeframe” as well as in the short term.\nThe acquisition system needs to move faster, Shyu said, and have more flexibility. China, she said, doesn’t suffer from the protracted process of funding requests, approvals, and oversight, and this allows them to obtain new technology faster.\n“Our budget process is a two-year process … and you have to have exquisite knowledge of what you need … five years into the future,” Shyu said, which is “crazy because threats may pop up that you didn’t anticipate.”\n“Right now, we have a problem: You did [research, development, test and evaluation]. Now, did you POM [submit a long-term plan] for the procurement money? If you didn’t … then it’s a year you’re sitting there waiting for the procurement money.”\nShyu asked, “Why would you do things like this to yourself? Right? Money is money.”\nShe said the Pentagon needs “a lot more flexibility to be able to pivot. It’s a rigid structure to which we shackle ourselves, like tying our shoelaces together and trying to run.” It would be a big help to “give us some colorless money, as well,” she said, referring to funding accounts that can only be used for certain kinds of technology efforts, often referred to as the “color of money” problem.\nAsked about friction in the breakup of the position of undersecretary of defense for acquisition, technology, and logistics into two jobs—hers, and that of theUSD for acquisition and sustainment, William A. LaPlante—Shyu said the friction is largely erased because of their working relationship.\nWhen Shyu was acquisition executive for the Army, LaPlante was the acquisition executive for the Air Force, and they have a solid partnership, she said.\nIf there’s a problem between the two enterprises, “it gets escalated up to us … and we fix it in five minutes. We trust each other,” she said. This “sets the example” for the two organizations to be collaborative, she said.\n",

        "input": "By THERESA HITCHENSon November 29, 2022 at 2:28 PM\nWASHINGTON — US Space Command already is eyeing further streamlining once itsjust-announced reorganizationsettles into place, including a move to merge two of its operational centers, according to SPACECOM chief Gen. Jim Dickinson.\n“Those are things that we’re looking at right now,” he told the Mitchell Institute in an online talk today.\nSPACECOM on Nov. 15 announced it had created a new headquarters structure, called theCombined Joint Task Force-Space Operations (CJTF-SO), to oversee those two commands responsible for day-to-day operations: theJoint Task Force-Space Defense(JTF-SD) and theCombined Force Space Component Command (CFSCC).\nThe JTF-SD, headquartered at Schriever SFB, Colo., is responsible for protecting and defending US space assets, including those belonging to the Intelligence Community via the bilateralNational Space Defense Center. The CFSCC, headquartered at Vandenberg SFB, Ca., takes care of space support functions for military operators, such as managing access to communications satellites and operating the GPS constellation. It is called a “combined force” command because it includes allied representatives.\nThe establishment of the CJTF-SO headquarters structure, Dickinson explained, was aimed at providing more “agility” and “flexibility” in decision-making than the old structure, which saw the leaders of both sub-commands reporting directly to him and SPACECOM headquarters staff.\nThe reorganization also means SPACECOM “will be able to synchronize both what we do from a space-enabling perspective as well as what we do for protect and defend on orbit,” and to avoid potential overlaps between those two inter-related missions, he said.\n“And so the purpose of CJTF-SO, as most higher headquarters, will be the synchronization of those missions and synchronization of those resources,” Dickinson said.\nAs a first step, he said, the new CJTF-SO headquarters staff is working now to establish “its functions and roles and missions,” leading up to a SPACECOM declaration of initial operational capability (IOC).\nBut Dickinson suggested SPACECOM wanted to see if it could go further to streamline that decision-making structure, by looking at “whether or not we need two command centers, whether they could be one — I mean, those are all options that we’re looking at right now,” he added.\nA SPACECOM spokesperson later in the day clarified that Dickinson was talking about two of the handful of operations centers that ultimately report up to him, rather than to overarching subordinate commands.\n“Gen. Dickinson was referencing a number of options the command is considering to ensure efficiency and effectiveness. When asked directly about any potential further consolidation, his response was referring to two of the operational centers within the command, not the operational commands themselves, as one of many options,” the spokesperson said in an email to Breaking Defense.\nDickinson also praised the Space Force’sNov. 23 standupof a new service component command at US Indo-Pacific Command headquarters in Hawaii.\n“I believe that’s the right place at the right time for that element to stand up,” he said.\nIn response to questions about how the INDOPACOM Space Force component — and by implication future planned service components at other combatant commands — will work with SPACECOM’s own regionally embeddedJoint Integrated Space Teams, Dickinson expressed no concerns about possible crossed wires.\nThe Space Force is a military service with the mission to organize, train and equip forces for operational combatant commands, of which SPACECOM is one. SPACECOM, which is both a geographical and a functional command, is responsible for ensuring other combatant commands are being provided necessary space capabilities to do their warfighting jobs, and that SPACECOM operators are responding to theater needs.\nFor example, Dickinson waived away the specter that the Space Force component might inject an additional layer of decision-making bureaucracy into the process for providing space capabilities to warfighters in the field.\n“There won’t be an additional layer,” he said. The Space Force component’s creation “is actually enhancing the relationship, if you will, between INDOPACOM and US Space Command,” he said.\nDickinson explained that all the other services have component commands at INDOPACOM — just as they do at all six other geographic combatant commands — and that the Space Force’s component will work in the same traditional way.\n“So, the INDOPACOM commander will look to that … space service component for all things space, if you will, in terms of support of his operations in his respective AOR [area of operations],” he said. “What will happen at that point will be the normal integration and coordination that would happen — that has happened [and] is happening right now — between that component and US Space Command in terms of making sure that we provide the space enabling capabilities that the INDOPACOM commander needs in support of his operations.”\nThe Guardians making up the service component command “work directly for the INDOPACOM commander, but there is a coordination relationship that already exists” with SPACECOM via the CFSCC, Dickinson added.\nThe CFSCC “executes tactical control over globally dispersed Air Force, Army, and Navy space [and now Space Force] units that command ground-based space capabilities and satellites in every orbital regime,” SPACECOM’swebsiteexplains.\nIn fact, Dickinson elaborated, Space Force created the new component by assigning to it Guardians already at INDOPACOM and familiar with the coordination process.\n“So, that relationship already exists and will continue to exist,” he said, and “will mature.”\n",

Alexandr Demyanchuk/TASS\nMOSCOW, January 30. /TASS/. Pyongyang may conduct a nuclear test in 2023, thus such a development should not be ruled out, the general director of the Russian International Affairs Council, Andrey Kortunov, told TASS on Monday.\nHe is certain that harsher rhetoric by the United States or South Korea will do nothing to deter the DPRK’s leadership.\nWhile analyzing the current tensions on the Korean Peninsula, the expert drew attention to South Korean President Yoon Sok-yeol’s statement in early January that South Korea might host nuclear weapons of another state or create its own, should the situation on the peninsula get worse due to North Korea’s nuclear program. Yoon’s statement came on the eve of NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg’s visits to Seoul and Tokyo, which a staffer of the DPRK’s International Policy Science Society, Kim Dong Myung, has already dubbed \"a prelude to confrontation and war\" in the Asia-Pacific Region (APR). Kortunov believes that against this background, it should not be ruled out that in its attempts to retaliate, Pyongyang may go as far as staging a nuclear test in 2023.\n\"We cannot write off this possibility,\" he stressed. \"Ballistic missile tests are already underway. Some very belligerent statements are being made by the North Korean leadership. Nuclear tests cannot be excluded. In any case, the DPRK, of course, will not give up nuclear weapons. This status is spelled out in the country’s Constitution.\"\nAt the same time, Kortunov noted that South Korea and the United States’ harsher rhetoric will not work as a deterrent, while China does enjoy certain political influence on Pyongyang. \"If Pyongyang shows restraint, it will do so not because of some statements by South Korea or the United States, or Japan. It may turn an attentive ear to China, since North Korean tests, to be carried out in the north, not far from the Chinese border, naturally, cause concern not only in the capitals of the DPRK’s geopolitical opponents, but also in Beijing and in Moscow,\" he continued.\nThe expert pointed out that amid mutual distrust in the region one should expect wider bilateral cooperation between South Korea and the United States and between South Korea and Japan. Overall tensions in the Asia-Pacific Region may soar. \"A variety of scenarios is possible,\" Kortunov noted. \"For one, the situation may aggravate along the demarcation line between North Korea and South Korea. Some clashes, provocations and an unintentional escalation are possible here. This is one possible scenario. Or, tensions in the Taiwan Strait, between the US and China may surge, if US-encouraged Taiwan begins to move more vigorously towards independence.\"\n",

SITUATION. I hope I am wrong. My gut tells me we will fight in 2025. [Chinese President Xi Jinping] secured his third term and set his war council in October 2022. Taiwan’s presidential elections are in 2024 and will offer Xi a reason. United States’ presidential elections are in 2024 and will offer Xi a distracted America. Xi’s team, reason, and opportunity are all aligned for 2025. We spent 2022 setting the foundation for victory. We will spend 2023 in crisp operational motion building on that foundation. If you want to know what the operational motion I demand looks like, look at what Total Force Team Charleston did in January.\n2. COMMANDER’S INTENT. Go faster. Drive readiness, integration, and agility for ourselves and the Joint Force to deter, and if required, defeat China. This is the first of 8 monthly directives from me. You need to know I alone own the pen on these orders. My expectations are high, and these orders are not up for negotiation. Follow them. I will be tough, fair, and loving in my approach to secure victory.\n3. END STATE. A fortified, ready, integrated, and agile Joint Force Maneuver Team ready to fight and win inside the first island chain. Maximize the use of the force and the tools we currently have and extract full value from things that currently exist. Close the gaps: C2, navigation, maneuver under attack, and tempo.\n4. RISK. Run deliberately, not recklessly. You will be governed by the principle of calculated training risk, which you shall interpret to mean the avoidance of death, serious injury, and Class A damage to attain higher readiness, integration, and agility. If the Tactic, Technique, and Procedure you are developing increases AMC’s ability to fight and win inside the first island chain… move out. If you are comfortable in your approach to training, then you are not taking enough risk.\n5. OT&E. Attached are our OT&E efforts from 2022 Fall PHOENIX Rally, which will guide our preparation but are not intended to limit creativity of approach. This is not an all-encompassing list.

Then, report all 2022 accomplishments preparing for the China fight, and forecast major efforts in 2023 through command chains by COB 28 February 2023.\n7. MARCH (Projected). (a) All units will report progress toward established OT&E requirements for INDOPACOM Operations discussed and reviewed at Fall PHOENIX Rally. (b) All AMC personnel will consider their personal affairs and whether a visit should be scheduled with their servicing base legal office to ensure they are legally ready and prepared. (c) KC-135 units will coordinate to provide a conceptual means of air delivering 100 off-the-shelf size and type UAVs from a single aircraft.\n8. APRIL (Projected).

The Russian Kornet anti-tank missile system is capable of piercing any smart active protection system of armor with a paired launch of missiles, Editor-in-Chief of Independent Military Review Dmitry Litovkin told TASS on Wednesday.\n\"It was pointed out that the Kornet self-propelled anti-tank missile systems can fire in tandem mode, specifically, two missiles can be launched at a time within a single command and control field to pierce the enemy armor’s active protection system. Both missiles thus launched follow each other in a single laser beam with a short interval, which helps deceive the armor’s smart protection systems, such as the Israeli Iron Fist developed by IMI,\" the expert said.\nThis system operates by firing a cluster of striking elements towards an incoming missile detected by its radar sensor to destroy the attacking element. However, this protection may fail against the Kornet as the second missile will accurately hit the target, even if the first projectile is destroyed, the expert explained.\nVarious aerosols and smokes are also used to protect the armor, the expert pointed out. \"However, this does not significantly reduce the efficiency of the smart Kornet missile,\" Litovkin said.\n\"Even if a smoke screen emerges all of a sudden while a missile approaches a target, the missile does not lose control and continues moving along the original flight path. Considering the missile’s velocity, the target will most likely have no time to change its position and will be wiped out, in spite of the smoke,\" the expert stressed.\nTandem-charge munition\nKornet missiles possess both the option to attack a target by a paired launch and tandem-charge warheads that strike explosive-reactive armor and pierce various add-on armor plates, he said.\n\"Importantly, the missile has a tandem-charge high-explosive warhead. This means that two charges explode in an attack. The first lead charge removes the target’s reactive armor while the follow-up charge directly wipes it out,\" the expert specified.\nAdd-on armor plates are frequently used to protect against such munitions, Litovkin noted.\n\"While experts say that slat armor protects against standard high-explosive munitions, it is less effective against tandem-charge high-explosive munitions similar to those employed by the Kornet,\" the military expert pointed out.\nKornet anti-tank missile system\nThe Kornet anti-tank missile system is designated to strike tanks and other armored targets, including vehicles outfitted with advanced reactive armor and active protection systems. The missile is directed by a laser beam. The Kornet anti-tank missile system’s firing range has been extended to 8 km whereas its previous versions have an engagement range of 5.5 km.\nDeputy CEO of the High Precision Weapons Company (part of the state tech corporation Rostec) Sergey Mikhailov said in early December that the Kornet-EM anti-tank missile system can be adapted to any type of chassis. In its baseline modification, the Kornet-EM is mounted on two telescopic masts that carry four missiles each, he said.\nThe Kornet is also popular among foreign customers. Director of Russia’s Federal Service for Military-Technical Cooperation Dmitry Shugayev told TASS at the Army 2021 international arms show on August 23 that Russia had received several requests on the potential delivery of self-propelled Kornet-EM systems based on the Tigr armored vehicles to foreign customers.\nSerbian President AleksandarVucic said on November 25 following talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Sochi that the first batch of Russian-made Kornet missile launchers would be delivered to Serbia by the end of this year.\n",

        "input": "Over the past several decades, researchers have moved from using electric currents to manipulating light waves in the near-infrared range for telecommunications applications such as high-speed 5G networks, biosensors on a chip, and driverless cars. This research area, known as integrated photonics, is fast evolving and investigators are now exploring the shorter—visible—wavelength range to develop a broad variety of emerging applications. These include chip-scale LIDAR (light detection and ranging), AR/VR/MR (augmented/virtual/mixed reality) goggles, holographic displays, quantum information processing chips, and implantable optogenetic probes in the brain.\nThe one device critical to all these applications in the visible range is an optical phase modulator, which controls the phase of a light wave, similar to how the phase of radio waves is modulated in wireless computer networks. With a phase modulator, researchers can build an on-chip optical switch that channels light into different waveguide ports. With a large network of these optical switches, researchers could create sophisticated integrated optical systems that could control light propagating on a tiny chip or light emission from the chip.\nBut phase modulators in the visible range are very hard to make: there are no materials that are transparent enough in the visible spectrum while also providing large tunability, either through thermo-optical or electro-optical effects. Currently, the two most suitable materials are silicon nitride and lithium niobate. While both are highly transparent in the visible range, neither one provides very much tunability. Visible-spectrum phase modulators based on these materials are thus not only large but also power-hungry: the length of individual waveguide-based modulators ranges from hundreds of microns to several mm and a single modulator consumes tens of mW for phase tuning. Researchers trying to achieve large-scale integration—embedding thousands of devices on a single microchip—have, up to now, been stymied by these bulky, energy-consuming devices.\nToday, Columbia Engineering researchers announced that they have found a solution to this problem—they've developed a way based on micro-ring resonators to dramatically reduce both the size and the power consumption of a visible-spectrum phase modulator, from 1 mm to 10 microns and from tens of mW for π phase tuning to below 1 mW. The study was published today by Nature Photonics.\n\"Usually the bigger something is, the better. But integrated devices are a notable exception,\" said Nanfang Yu, associate professor of applied physics, co-principal investigator (PI) on the team, and an expert in nanophotonics. \"It's really hard to confine light to a spot and manipulate it without losing much of its power. We are excited that in this work we've made a breakthrough that will greatly expand the horizon of large-scale visible-spectrum integrated photonics.\"\nConventional optical phase modulators operating at visible wavelengths are based on light propagation in waveguides. Yu worked with his colleague Michal Lipson, who is the leading expert on integrated photonics based on silicon nitride, to develop a very different approach.\n\"The key to our solution was to use an optical resonator and to operate it in the so-called strongly over-coupled regime,\" said Lipson, co-PI on the team and Eugene Higgins Professor of Electrical Engineering and professor of applied physics.\nOptical resonators are structures with a high degree of symmetry, such as rings that can cycle a beam of light many times and translate tiny refractive index changes to a large phase modulation. Resonators can operate under several different conditions and so need to be used carefully. For example, if operating in the \"under coupled\" or \"critical coupled\" regimes, a resonator will only provide a limited phase modulation and, more problematically, introduce a large amplitude variation to the optical signal. The latter is a highly undesirable optical loss because accumulation of even moderate losses from individual phase modulators will prevent cascading them to form a circuit that has a sufficiently large output signal.\nTo achieve a complete 2π phase tuning and minimal amplitude variation, the Yu-Lipson team chose to operate a micro-ring in the \"strongly over-coupled\" regime, a condition where the coupling strength between the micro-ring and the \"bus\" waveguide that feeds light into the ring is at least 10 times stronger than the loss of the micro-ring. \"The latter is primarily due to optical scattering at the nanoscale roughness on the device sidewalls,\" Lipson explained. \"You can never fabricate photonic devices with perfectly smooth surfaces.\"\nThe team developed several strategies to push the devices into the strongly over-coupled regime. The most crucial one was their invention of an adiabatic micro-ring geometry, where the ring smoothly transitions between a narrow neck and a wide belly, which are at the opposite edges of the ring. The narrow neck of the ring facilitates the exchange of light between the bus waveguide and the micro-ring, thus enhancing the coupling strength. The ring's wide belly reduces optical loss because the guided light interacts only with the outer sidewall, not the inner sidewall, of the widened portion of the adiabatic micro-ring, substantially reducing optical scattering at the sidewall roughness.\nIn a comparative study of adiabatic micro-rings and conventional micro-rings with uniform width fabricated side by side on the same chip, the team found that none of the conventional micro-rings satisfied the strong over-coupling condition—in fact, they suffered very bad optical losses—while 63% of the adiabatic micro-rings kept operating in the strongly over-coupled regime.\n\"Our best phase modulators operating at the blue and green colors, which are the most difficult portion of the visible spectrum, have a radius of only 5 microns, consume power of 0.8 mW for π phase tuning, and introduce an amplitude variation of less than 10%,\" said Heqing Huang, a graduate student in Yu's lab and first author of the paper. \"No prior work has demonstrated such compact, power-efficient, and low-loss phase modulators at visible wavelengths.\"\nThe devices were designed in Yu's lab and fabricated in the Columbia Nano Initiative cleanroom, at the Advanced Science Research Center NanoFabrication Facility at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, and at the Cornell NanoScale Science and Technology Facility. Device characterization was conducted in Lipson's and Yu's labs.\nThe researchers note that while they are nowhere near the degree of integration of electronics, their work shrinks the gap between photonic and electronic switches substantially. \"If previous modulator technologies only allow for integration of 100 waveguide phase modulators given a certain chip footprint and power budget, now we can do that 100 times better and integrate 10,000 phase shifters on chip to realize much more sophisticated functions,\" said Yu.\nThe Lipson and Yu labs are now collaborating to demonstrate visible-spectrum LIDAR consisting of large 2D arrays of phase shifters based on adiabatic micro-rings. The design strategies employed for their visible-spectrum thermo-optical devices can be applied to electro-optical modulators to reduce their footprints and drive voltages, and can be adapted in other spectral ranges (e.g., ultraviolet, telecom, mid-infrared, and THz) and in other resonator designs beyond micro-rings.\n\"Thus, our work can inspire future effort where people can implement strong over-coupling in a wide range of resonator-based devices to enhance light-matter interactions, for example, for enhancing optical nonlinearity, for making novel lasers, for observing novel quantum optical effects, while suppressing optical losses at the same time,\" Lipson said.\n",

(Credit: Northrop Grumman)\nEnabling the future Habitation and Logistics Outpost (HALO) servicing astronauts on their way to the Moon\nMADRID 11 January 2022 (Airbus PR)—Airbus Crisa,an affiliate company of Airbus, has signed a contract for the development of the Power Management and Distribution (PMAD) system for the Habitation and Logistics Outpost (HALO) with Northrop Grumman.\nAirbus Crisa is a Spanish company founded in 1985 to design and manufacture electronic equipment and software for space applications, and engineering projects for ground stations. It is fully integrated into Airbus Defence and Space.\nThe new Lunar Gateway station, scheduled for launch in 2024, will initially have two modules and will be expanded in successive years to five modules. The station is intended to serve as a space laboratory as well as an intermediate logistics post for future trips to the surface of the Moon and on to Mars. The two initial modules are known as PPE and HALO. PPE (Power and Propulsion Element) has solar arrays that power the station and thrusters that allow it to maintain a stable orbit around the Moon. HALO is the Habitation and Logistics Outpost module where the astronauts will live during the estimated 40 days of the first missions.\n“This contract worth more than $50 million reflects our ability to deliver highly specialised space equipment to global manufacturers and is our first contribution to the Moon-orbiting Gateway, which is part of NASA’s Artemis programme to return to the Moon,” said Fernando Gómez-Carpintero, CEO of Airbus Crisa. “This is an exciting step as Airbus Crisa is designing the PMAD to become the standard modular power management system for all future space stations and human vehicles. We have provided a disruptive solution, with an architectural concept never before seen in the sector. This lays the foundations for a new international standard, placing the company at the forefront of the sector.”\nThe PMAD has four power units and will manage the electricity from the solar panels of the Power and Propulsion Element (PPE). It will distribute the power to onboard equipment and the rest of the station as required, always ensuring the safety of the crew on board. The PMAD will power the life support system, the interior lighting, the communications systems and the scientific experiments. It will ensure that HALO’s battery remains at optimal levels and is ready for use when the panels do not receive sufficient sunlight. PMAD must also provide power to visiting vehicles when they dock.\nAirbus Crisa is a key international player in the fields of power conversion digital control and energy management and distribution for satellite and launcher applications thanks to the experience gained in the challenging ESA exploration missions. This contract demonstrates its great potential to provide reliable flight products to US manufacturers.\n",

        "input": "May 10\nThe Army has already tested a ramjet that could power a future extended-range version of the Precision Strike Missile, according to senior service officials. Future increments of PrSM, the upcoming replacement for the Army Tactical Missile System, are expected to feature an anti-ship seeker, increased lethality and extended range. But the Army has not previously said that the extra range would come from a ramjet. Senior Army acquisition and modernization officials disclosed the ramjet plans and previous testing in testimony submitted for a Senate Armed Services tactical air and land forces subcommittee hearing today. “We successfully tested the Land Based Anti-Ship Missile seeker and Extended Range Propulsion ramjet, setting conditions for subsequent increments of the PrSM program,” the written testimony states. A ramjet is a form of air-breathing engine that relies upon high-velocity forward motion to compress air. Unlike a traditional jet engine, a ramjet doesn't require a fan to compress air. Compared to more traditional missiles, which carry oxidizers with their fuel, ramjets would provide greater range at less weight, Al Shoffner, a retired Army two-star general and a former director of the Fires Center of Excellence, told Inside Defense. “The advantage it has over a conventional rocket or missile is that it doesn’t have to carry as much fuel because it’s mixed with oxygen as it travels,” Shoffner said. “That allows a few things: One, reduction in weight, which is really critical, and then more room for other things that you would require payload for, such as a guidance system and the warhead.” The Army has not fielded a system with a ramjet before, he said. They have been a topic of study “for a long time,” and the technology has improved in recent years. “I think we’re to the point where we’re more confident that this will actually work, and that it can be demonstrated,” Shoffner said. Army applied research budget documents detail plans to develop an “air-breathing propulsion subsystem,” which is likely the ramjet program, for a future PrSM variant. The Army “will complete flight weight combined cycle air-breathing propulsion subsystem design and begin fabrication and integration for follow-on experiments and assessments” in fiscal year 2023, according to the budget documents. The budget request includes $8.8 million for that line of effort. Experiments in FY-22 will explore the ability of the same “air-breathing propulsion subsystem” to increase missile range “in the same form factor as traditional solid propellant rocket motor subsystems,” according to the budget documents. These science and technology developments will inform the range requirements for the future extended-range PrSM increment, the director of the Army’s Long-Range Precision Fires Cross-Functional Team told Inside Defense in October. PrSM has become one of the lead programs in the Army’s long-range fires modernization priority, which it expects will be necessary for future large-scale combat. The missile is compatible with existing rocket launchers, and two PrSMs can fit in the same rocket pod that holds a single ATACMS. An initial increment of PrSM is on schedule to be fielded at the end of FY-23 under an urgent materiel release, according to Army budget documents. That base missile will have a range of at least 500 kilometers, although the exact capability is currently unknown. Telemetry data stopped at 499 km in an October maximum-distance test, but the missile flew farther, according to the former chief of Army Futures Command. Initial operational testing on the base PrSM is planned for the first quarter of FY-25, and the missile could reach initial operational capability by the fourth quarter of that year. A demonstration of PrSM Increment 2, with the ship-hunting seeker, could take place at the beginning of FY-27, and that variant of the missile could be fielded by the end of FY-27. Increments 3 and 4, with increased lethality and extended range, would follow. The Army has funded research into ramjets that could extend the range of cannon artillery. A round would be shot out of a cannon using traditional artillery propellants, and the ramjet could turn on once the round reaches high enough speeds. A ramjet-powered missile would still require traditional missile propulsion, so that it can reach the speeds necessary for the ramjet to work, Shoffner said. A ramjet is typically most efficient at two or three times the speed of sound.\n",

With this, it was made apparent that Kyrgyzstan is AKSUNGUR’s first foreign customer.\nThe Kyrgyzstan National Security State Committee’s press center and TAI have not made an official statement about how many AKSUNGUR drones Kyrgyzstan will purchase, what configurations these UAVs will be in, or the cost of the deal. Kyrgyzstan, which had previously purchased Bayraktar TB2 and Bayraktar Ak?nc? drones from Turkey, also did not share the specifics of those agreements. Kyrgyzstan is expected to use these vehicles, along with Bayraktar TB2 and Ak?nc? drones, primarily in reconnaissance and surveillance operations along the Tajikistan border. Kyrgyzstan, which has frequent border disputes with Tajikistan, is also likely to employ Aksungur’s combat capabilities.\nFollowing its first export success with Kyrgyzstan, Aksungur’s next customer appears to be Indonesia. TAI General Manager Temel Kotil told SavunmaSanayiST at the Indo Defense Expo & Forum 2022 Fair held in Jakarta from November 2-5 that Indonesia needs ANKA and AKSUNGUR unmanned aerial vehicles. “We don’t discuss ventures that haven’t signed a contract,” Kotil continued in his statement, “but we will continue to discuss all of these products with the authorities here, and I’m hoping for good news from Indonesia.” Furthermore, TAI UAV Systems Deputy General Manager Dr. ?mer Y?ld?z told Anadolu Agency in September that two of three African countries are interested in purchasing Aksungur drones, with one interested in Anka UAVs. Furthermore, the Algerian-based MENADefense website reported last month that Algeria had ordered six TAI AKSUNGUR UAVs. According to the reports, Algeria was AKSUNGUR’s first foreign customer with this deal. TAI, however, later denied this information.\nThe Turkish Navy, Air Force, and Special Missions (MT) are currently actively using the Aksungur, an advanced and larger version of the ANKA unmanned aerial vehicle. According to TAI, the Aksungur’s developer, the drone is a Medium Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) class capable of performing Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) and offensive operations day and night with EO/IR, SAR, and SIGINT payloads. In addition to its many other uses, Aksungur can be used for electronic and signal intelligence operations.\nAksungur has a length of 11.6 meters, a wingspan of 24 meters, a maximum take-off weight of 3300 kilograms, and a cargo capacity of 750 kilograms. Due to two TEI PD-170 turbo diesel engines with three-bladed propellers, the drone has 340 horsepower and a top speed of 100 knots (180 km/h) at sea level. The drone can fly for 12 hours with 750 kg of external payload during an Assault/Naval Patrol Mission, and 24 hours with 150 kg of payload during a Signal Intelligence Mission. Each of Aksungur’s wings has three pylons. From the inside out, they’re rated to carry loads weighing 500, 300, and 150 kg. Aksungur’s weapon options, according to TAI’s official page, include the MAM-L, MAM-C, Cirit, L-UMTAS, TEBER-81, TEBER-82, KGK-82, HGK-3, and the Miniature Bomb. Until now, the Aksungur drone has flown with 12 MAM-Ls in August 2020. Furthermore, Aksungur tested the TEBER-82 guidance kit developed by Roketsan for Mk-82 type general purpose bombs and the KGK-S?HA-82 developed by TUBITAK SAGE. Kuzgun munitions developed by T?B?TAK SAGE and Sungur air defense missiles developed by ROKETSAN are also expected to be integrated into Aksungur drones in the future.\n",

Options have included either a modernized F135 “Enhanced Engine Package” or an advanced engine from AETP, which would provide substantial increases in performance and efficiency.\nEngines from AETP are likely to power the Air Force’s planned sixth-generation fighter, the Next Generation Air Dominance platform. But both Congress and the Air Force has expressed an interest in getting those engines on the F-35 as well—lawmakers have introduced legislation requiring such a change starting in 2027, and Kendall said early in his tenure that he’d like to do so if it’s affordable.\nThat, however, has been a major sticking point. The Joint Program Office has made clear that any member of the F-35 program that wants to be “different” has to pay the full cost for that, which would include the development and integration of the AETP engines.\nIt’s unclear whether the Navy, the Marine Corps, or any of the other nations in the F-35 program are interested in splitting the costs of such an effort with the Air Force. GE Aviation, the maker of one of the AETP engines, has said its engine wouldn’t be able to go in the Marines’ F-35Bs, though it would fit on the Navy’s F-35Cs.\nNone of the other services or partners have agreed on the need for the AETP engine, Kendall confirmed to Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine).\n“Each of the services and each of our partners is in a different situation with regard to the economics of doing that and the performance requirements,” Kendall said. “We have the largest fleet in the Air Force—we will have the largest fleet. So we have the greatest interest in this, I think, but there’s a significant cost associated with a brand new engine, development of that. It’s less expensive to do an upgrade, perhaps, and get increased performance, and then there are other options in between.”\nWith so many different perspectives and needs to juggle, Kendall said that the Office of the Secretary of Defense will need to make a final call on any changes, seemingly hinting that the Air Force won’t look to “go it alone” with their own separate effort.\n“The Department of Defense has to make a decision overall about engine modifications and upgrades for the F-35. I expect that process to take place over the next few months as we build the [2024] budget,” Kendall told Collins. “What the Air Force has funded is continuing the AETP technology development, but we’re going to need to have a decision at a higher level about the overall program for F-35 engine modifications and upgrades.”\nThe Pentagon and the Air Force released their 2023 budget request in late March, and Congress is in the process of marking up that budget. Planning for the 2024 budget, however, is already underway.\n“It’s a complicated situation, and we’re going to have to sort it out at the DOD level as we go through the process of preparing the 2024 budget,” Kendall said.\n",

        "input": "Seoul will also develop defence and surveillance systems to enhance the military’s readiness against mounting North Korean threats.\nSEOUL – South Korea is developing homegrown combat weapons, defense and surveillance systems to enhance the military’s deterrence and readiness posture against mounting and persisting North Korean threats, the head of South Korea’s state arms procurement agency told The Korea Herald.\nThe expeditious completion of the homegrown three-axis defense system — which consists of the Kill Chain preemptive strike mechanism, the Korea Air and Missile Defense (KAMD) and the Korea Massive Punishment and Retaliation (KMPR) — is essential to that end, he said.\n“The government plans to push ahead with 250 discrete tasks, including the development of weapons systems and defense technologies, next year to secure capabilities for the indigenous three-axis defense system to strengthen the South Korean military’s capabilities to counter escalating nuclear and missile threats from North Korea,” Eom Dong-hwan, minister of the Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA), said in an interview.\nSouth Korea has specifically sought to build a multilayered missile defense shield to complete the KAMD as North Korea has developed more survivable and maneuverable ballistic missiles, including KN-23, KN-24, and KN-25 short-range ballistic missiles, to penetrate and incapacitate missile defenses.\nUS-made Patriot missile interceptors and homegrown Cheongung II missiles — which have been deployed in South Korea — can engage incoming ballistic missiles at altitudes up to 40 kilometers. The US Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system provides the upper tier of a multilayered missile defense system and is capable of intercepting missiles at altitudes of 40-150 km in their terminal phase.\nBut South Korea has particularly strived to build up homegrown middle and upper-tier missile defenses — which have not yet developed — against mounting North Korean missile threats.\n“The long-range surface-to-air missile, L-SAM, is a weapon system that intends to intercept missiles at higher altitudes than the Cheongung II, and we have been conducting flight tests of guided missiles and missile interception tests aiming to complete system development by 2024,” Eom said.\n“Our goal is to mass produce and deploy the L-SAM within two to three years after system development is completed in 2024.”\nThe L-SAM has been developed to shoot down hostile missiles at altitudes between 50 and 60 km, and then South Korea plans to upgrade the L-SAM to the L-SAM 2.\n“A pilot research on the L-SAM 2 has been underway,” Eom said. “If a series of the L-SAM (1 and 2) is deployed, we expect multilayered missile defense systems in the South Korean airspace will be further strengthened.”\nSouth Korea also seeks to precipitate the deployment of the Low Altitude Missile Defense (LAMD) system, which is analogous to Israel’s “Iron Dome” interceptor, in the capital and densely populated areas. The plan aims to counter threats posed by North Korea’s artillery and multiple rocket launchers.\n“We’ve carried out policy tasks including expeditious deployment of the long-range artillery interception system in order to strengthen the South Korean military’s system to counter threats posed by North Korea’s long-range artillery to the capital area,” Eom said.\n“The government has put efforts to reduce the time required to develop and deploy long-range artillery interceptor systems by minimizing administrative lead time and securing core technologies in advance before starting research and development in earnest.”\nSouth Korea commenced “exploratory development” of long-range artillery interceptor systems this year.\nEyes, ears on battlefield\nEom underscored the importance of South Korea’s efforts to domestically secure “cutting-edge military technologies” to complete the homegrown three-axis defense system.\nSouth Korea has pursued locally developing technologies for “surveillance and reconnaissance, command and control which is yet insufficient” to build the Kill Chain system, according to Eom.\nLocally developing intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities is essential to complete the Kill Chain system.\nThe Kill Chain — which is the first axis of South Korea’s homegrown three-pronged defense system — intends to detect, locate and select enemy targets for action. The system therefore enables South Korea to conduct a preemptive attack against the enemy in case of contingency scenarios.\n“We also endeavor to develop independent ISR capabilities in multiple domains from space to ground,” Eom said, admitting South Korea’s high dependence on the US’ ISR assets.\n“In space, a project to develop military reconnaissance satellites (the 425 project) — which is the core of the Kill Chain system — has been underway without a hitch. If satellites are deployed by 2025 after conducting tests and evaluations beginning from 2023, it will contribute to improving our military’s independent surveilling capabilities.”\nIn the air, high-altitude unmanned aerial vehicles (HUAVs), airborne early warning and control aircraft and Baekdu reconnaissance aircraft have been deployed and monitored the entire Korean Peninsula.\nEom said South Korea is set to mass produce homegrown medium-altitude unmanned aerial vehicles (MUAVs). Testing and evaluation of the reconnaissance unmanned aerial vehicle-II to be operated by corps-level units have been in progress.\nOn the ground, South Korea has operated Green Pine anti-ballistic missile radars to detect and track ballistic missiles while “researching and developing a project to replace imported, obsolete long-range radars.”\nSouth Korea plans to begin to deploy first locally developed long-range radars from 2026, according to Eom.\nSouth Korea’s long-range radars will monitor and detect targets including aircraft in the Korea Air Defense Identification Zone (KADIZ) and send data to the Air Force’s Master Control and Reporting Center for air defense. At the MCRC, the Air Force monitors the South and North Korean airspace around the clock and controls and commands all aircraft flying over the Korean Peninsula as well as air defense assets.\nIn addition, South Korea plans to commence the development of a microsatellite system this December and put dozens of microsatellites in clusters into orbit by 2030.\nEom underlined that the interconnected operation of military spy satellites and ultrasmall satellite constellations will reduce revisit times for satellites, which is the time interval between observations of the same location on Earth by satellites.\n“South Korea’s surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities will be improved if the country can shorten revisit times over the Korean Peninsula by operating high-performance military reconnaissance satellites and microsatellite systems in a complementary manner.”\nEom explained that the DAPA has actively pushed forward various projects, including the 425 project and long-range artillery interception system, to “localize defense and combat systems, setting the goal of localization rate in producing components of each defense project is higher than 70 to 90 percent.”\nKF-21 exports\nThe DAPA head also stressed that South Korea’s first homegrown KF-21 fighter aircraft will “fill the security vacuum by replacing long-running fighter jets and contribute to defending territorial airspace and national security.”\nSouth Korea in July began a long journey of 2,200 test flights that will run until 2026. Around 120 KF-21 fighter jets will be deployed to South Korean Air Force bases by 2032.\nA 4.5th-generation KF-21 Boramae aircraft – which has very low observability compared to a fourth-generation fighter — will be assessed as cut out for the future battlefield, Eom explained, underscoring that KF-21 fighter aircraft will be utilized as the “core combat power of South Korea’s Air Force.”\nEom said South Korea is able to refurbish and upgrade domestic-made KF-21 fighter jets at discretion with proprietary technology, playing up to one of the advantages of domestically developing combat fighter aircraft.\nSouth Korea has been running up against certain limitations when it seeks to upgrade imported foreign fighter jets to meet the military’s needs or arm imported fighter jets with domestically produced weapons. Such a process requires permission from a manufacturing country.\n“However, locally developed KF-21 aircraft will enable the development of its derivatives and localization of aircraft equipment and weapons to meet operational needs,” Eom said, adding that KF-21 fighter aircraft can be utilized as a part of a manned-unmanned-teaming (MUM-T) system should South Korea develop unmanned fighter aircraft.\nSouth Korea’s KF-21 will also gain a competitive edge against European rivals in the cut-throat global fighter aircraft market, Eom said.\nSouth Korea is bullish on the potential for exporting KF-21 fighter aircraft.\n“KF-21 fighter jet is expected to be competitive against Europe-produced aircraft in terms of aircraft acquisition cost, efficiency of aircraft maintenance and operations and operations and maintenance costs,” Eom said. The operational lifespan of a fighter jet is usually several decades.\nSouth Korea has also gained worldwide recognition for its technology through continuing exports of FA-50 light attack aircraft and T-50 advanced supersonic jet trainers.\n“We expect that KF-21 fighter aircraft will have export competitiveness in countries which plan to operate fourth or 4.5th-generation fighter jets instead of fifth-generation fighters as well as countries in the Middle East and Southeast Asia that have operated FA/T-50 aircraft,” Eom said.\n“The competitiveness of KF-21 aircraft will be further enhanced in the export market if we develop its ability to operate weapons by continuously developing domestic aircraft weapons and pursuing system integration as well as reduce costs in mass production by increasing production of aircraft.”\n",

        "input": "\"The scan speed reduces costs significantly,\" said ORNL lead researcher Amir Ziabari. \"And the quality is higher, so the post-processing analysis becomes much simpler.\"\nThe framework is already being incorporated into software used by commercial partner ZEISS within its machines at DOE's Manufacturing Demonstration Facility at ORNL, where companies hone 3D-printing methods.\nORNL researchers had previously developed technology that can analyze the quality of a part while it is being printed. Adding a high level of imaging accuracy after printing provides an additional level of trust in additive manufacturing while potentially increasing production.\n\"With this, we can inspect every single part coming out of 3D-printing machines,\" said Pradeep Bhattad, ZEISS business development manager for additive manufacturing. \"Currently CT is limited to prototyping. But this one tool can propel additive manufacturing toward industrialization.\"\nX-ray CT scanning is important for certifying the soundness of a 3D-printed part without damaging it. The process is similar to medical X-ray CT. In this case, an object set inside a cabinet is slowly rotated and scanned at each angle by powerful X-rays. Computer algorithms use the resulting stack of two-dimensional projections to construct a 3D image showing the density of the object's internal structure. X-ray CT can be used to detect defects, analyze failures or certify that a product matches the intended composition and quality.\nHowever, X-ray CT is not used at large scale in additive manufacturing because current methods of scanning and analysis are time-intensive and imprecise. Metals can totally absorb the lower-energy X-rays in the X-ray beam, creating image inaccuracies that can be further multiplied if the object has a complex shape. The resulting flaws in the image can obscure cracks or pores the scan is intended to reveal. A trained technician can correct for these problems during analysis, but the process is time- and labor-intensive.\nZiabari and his team developed a deep-learning framework that rapidly provides a clearer, more accurate reconstruction and an automated analysis. He will present the process his team developed during the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers International Conference on Image Processing in October.\nTraining a supervised deep-learning network for CT usually requires many expensive measurements. Because metal parts pose additional challenges, getting the appropriate training data can be difficult. Ziabari's approach provides a leap forward by generating realistic training data without requiring extensive experiments to gather it.\nA generative adversarial network, or GAN, method is used to synthetically create a realistic-looking data set for training a neural network, leveraging physics-based simulations and computer-aided design. GAN is a class of machine learning that utilizes neural networks competing with each other as in a game. It has rarely been used for practical applications like this, Ziabari said.\nBecause this X-ray CT framework needs scans with fewer angles to achieve accuracy, it has reduced imaging time by a factor of six, Ziabari said -- from about one hour to 10 minutes or less. Working that quickly with so few viewing angles would normally add significant \"noise\" to the 3D image. But the ORNL algorithm taught on the training data corrects this, even enhancing small flaw detection by a factor of four or more.\nThe framework developed by Ziabari's team would allow manufacturers to rapidly fine-tune their builds, even while changing designs or materials. With this approach, sample analysis can be completed in a day instead of six to eight weeks, Bhattad said.\n\"If I can very rapidly inspect the whole part in a very cost-effective way, then we have 100% confidence,\" he said. \"We are partnering with ORNL to make CT an accessible and reliable industry inspection tool.\"\nORNL researchers evaluated the performance of the new framework on hundreds of samples printed with different scan parameters, using complicated, dense materials. These results were good, and ongoing trials at MDF are working to verify that the technique is equally effective with any type of metal alloy, Bhattad said.\nThat's important, because the approach developed by Ziabari's team could make it far easier to certify parts made from new metal alloys. \"People don't use novel materials because they don't know the best printing parameters,\" Ziabari said. \"Now, if you can characterize these materials so quickly and optimize the parameters, that would help move these novel materials into additive manufacturing.\"\nIn fact, Ziabari said, the technology can be applied in many fields, including defense, auto manufacturing, aerospace and electronics printing, as well as nondestructive evaluation of electric vehicle batteries.\n",

M2NS also uses RE2’s advanced computer vision and autonomy software, RE2 Detect and RE2 Intellect, to enable the precise, autonomous, and clandestine neutralization of a target.\nDuring the test event, which took place in the Pacific Ocean with support from the Naval Information Warfare Center Pacific in Point Loma, California, four successful dives exceeding 1,000 meters of depth were completed. The dives were conducted using supervised autonomy, which allows human operators to monitor the robotic system’s autonomous movements and make corrections if necessary.\n“These tests allowed us to demonstrate the continuing success of the M2NS project for the U.S.\nNavy,” said Jack Reinhart, vice president of project management, RE2 Robotics. “The progress we made during these deep dives shows that we could successfully complete an underwater supervised autonomous mission at depths of more than 1,000 meters without any damage to the system. The M2NS system succeeded where no other system of this class has before.”\nAll onboard electronics remained operational during the deep dives, including the ROV’s camera feed and data to the support vessel, proving the survivability of the complete system to a depth of more than 1,000 meters.\n“We have proven the ability to deploy the Defender with a large payload to depths of 3,500 feet [1,000-plus meters] from a small deck footprint,” said Marcus Kolb, chief technology officer, VideoRay. “We performed complex, autonomous manipulation tasks with the RE2 system while station-keeping a few feet off the bottom. We are excited about the direction of this program and how it will help accelerate commercial solutions.”\nFollowing the success of these dives, RE2 Robotics and VideoRay are planning future demonstrations for ONR to test the system’s autonomy capabilities using a tetherless ROV at extended depths.

        "input": "Portable, low-field-strength MRI systems have the potential to transform neuroimaging – provided that their low spatial resolution and low signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio can be overcome. Researchers at Harvard Medical School are harnessing artificial intelligence (AI) to achieve this goal. They have developed a machine learning super-resolution algorithm that generates synthetic images with high spatial resolution from lower resolution brain MRI scans.\nThe convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm, known as LF-SynthSR, converts low-field-strength (0.064 T) T1- and T2-weighted brain MRI sequences into isotropic images with 1 mm spatial resolution and the appearance of a T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MP-RAGE) acquisition. Describing their proof-of-concept study in Radiology, the researchers report that the synthetic images exhibited high correlation with images acquired by 1.5 T and 3.0 T MRI scanners.\nPrincipal investigator Juan Eugenio Iglesias from Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School.\nMorphometry, the quantitative size and shape analysis of structures in an image, is central to many neuroimaging studies. Unfortunately, most MRI analysis tools are designed for near-isotropic, high-resolution acquisitions and typically require T1-weighted images such as MP-RAGE. Their performance often drops rapidly as voxel size and anisotropy increase. As the vast majority of existing clinical MRI scans are highly anisotropic, they cannot be reliably analysed with existing tools.\n“Millions of low-resolution brain MR images are produced every year, but currently cannot be analysed with neuroimaging software,” explains principal investigator Juan Eugenio Iglesias. “The main goal of my current research is to develop algorithms that make low-resolution brain MR images look like the high-resolution MRI scans that we use in research. I am particularly interested in two applications: enabling automated 3D analysis of the clinical scans and use with portable, low-field MRI scanners.”\nTraining and testing\nLF-SynthSR is built upon SynthSR, a method developed by the team to train a CNN to predict 1 mm-resolution MP-RAGE isotropic scans from routine clinical MR scans. Previous findings reported in NeuroImage showed that SynthSR-generated images could be reliably used for subcortical segmentation and volumetry, image registration and, if some quality requirements are met, even cortical thickness morphometry.\nBoth LF-SynthSR and SynthSR are trained on synthetic input images of highly varying appearance generated from 3D segmentations, and can thus be used to train CNNs for any combination of contrast, resolution and orientation.\nIglesias points out that neural networks perform best when data appear approximately constant, but every hospital uses scanners from different vendors that are configured differently, resulting in highly heterogeneous scans. “To tackle this problem, we are borrowing ideas from a field of machine learning called ‘domain randomization’, where you train neural networks with synthetic images that are simulated to constantly change appearance and resolution, in order to obtain trained networks that are agnostic to the appearance of the input images,” he explains.\nTo assess the performance of LF-SynthSR, the researchers correlated brain morphology measurements between synthetic MRIs and ground-truth high-field strength images. For training, they used a high-field-strength MRI dataset of 1-mm isotropic MP-RAGE scans from 20 subjects. They also used corresponding segmentations of 36 brain regions-of-interest (ROIs) and three extracerebral ROIs. The training set was also artificially augmented to better model pathologic tissue such as stroke or haemorrhage.\nThe test set comprised imaging data from 24 participants with neurological symptoms who had a low-field strength (0.064 T) scan in addition to a standard-of-care high-field strength (1.5–3 T) MRI. The algorithm successfully generated 1-mm isotropic synthetic MP-RAGE images from the low-field strength brain MRIs, with voxels more than 10 times smaller than in the original data. Automated segmentation of the synthetic images from a final sample of 11 participants yielded ROI volumes that were highly correlated with those derived from the high-field strength MR scans.\n“LF-SynthSR may improve the image quality of low-field strength MRI scans to the point that they are usable not only by automated segmentation methods but potentially also with registration and classification algorithms,” the researchers write. “It could also be used to augment the detection of abnormal lesions.”\nThis ability to analyse low-resolution brain MRIs using automated morphometry would enable the study of rare diseases and populations that are under-represented in current neuroimaging research. In addition, improving the quality of images from portable MRI scanners would enhance their use in medically underserved areas, as well as in critical care, where moving patients to an MRI suite is often too risky.\nIglesias says that another challenge is the wide range of abnormalities found in clinical scans that need to be handled by the CNN. “Currently, SynthSR works well with healthy brains, cases with atrophy, and smaller abnormalities like small multiple sclerosis lesions or small strokes,” he tells Physics World. “We are currently working to improve the method so it can effectively deal with larger lesions, like larger strokes or tumours.”\nWriting in an accompanying editorial in Radiology, Birgit Ertl-Wagner and Matthias Wagner from the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto comment: “This exciting technical development study demonstrates the potential to go low on field strength and aim high for spatial and contrast resolution using artificial intelligence.”\n",

MBDA started the development of the Enforcer compact missile system in 2014, upon completion of a demonstration programme. Developed under a German-led, multi-national MBDA programme, Enforcer is one of the largest self-financed projects of MBDA. The development phase included multiple guided firings trails at the German Bundeswehr’s Technical Center for Weapons and Ammunition 91 in November 2016. In December 2019, MBDA signed a contract with Germany to supply Enforcer missile systems for use by the German Armed Forces. Germany selected the missile to meet its Leichtes Wirkmittel 1800+ requirement.\nThe Enforcer shoulder launched weapon system provides low-collateral precision effects capabilities against the threat from lightly armoured static and moving targets, targets behind cover, and against targets at long range also in urban environments. Enforcer is a 2km-class disposable shoulder-launched guided munition, which provides stand-off capability for forces while engaging targets on the battlefield. The missile weighs less than 7kg and the system along with sight and two munitions weighs less than 20kg. The combined weight of the missile and the launch tube is less than 9kg. The weapon can engage targets within the range between 1,000m and 2,000m. The compact size and dimension of the missile make it more efficient and easier to carry and use in asymmetrical conflict zones.\nEnforcer possesses increased capabilities than the existing infantry weapon systems. The missile is equipped with a lock-on before launch (LOBL) feature. The fire-and-forget missile has the capability to destroy lightly-armoured and soft-skinned targets. It is also effective against hidden targets due to its airburst capabilities. The weapon system has been designed to have the lowest possible collateral damage, and can be easily operable by a single soldier. The missile’s seeker head guides it directly to the centre of the predetermined target. Enforcer has the capacity to perform day and night operations and displays firing capability in enclosed spaces. It carries a multi-effect warhead that can hit targets with high precision over full range.\nThe modular design of the Enforcer system enables a range of future development options, including a prospective ‘family’ of Enforcer munitions for land, air and sea applications. The shoulder-launched Enforcer missile serves as a basis for a new air-launched variant called Enforcer Air. Enforcer Air was unveiled at the Berlin Security Conference 2019 held in Berlin, in November 2019. Enforcer Air has been developed by MBDA Deutschland. It comes with various launching options including drop-launched, tube-launched and rail-launched. The missile can be carried by helicopters, tactical unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and medium-latitude long-endurance (MALE) UAVs. The air-launched missile is primarily being offered to Germany.\n",

In their paper published in the journal Science Advances, the group describes the inspiration for the robot, how it was built and how well it worked when tested on animal tissue.\nThe researchers began their work by noting that soft-bodied robots capable of moving around inside confined spaces have already been developed. But they also noted that improvements needed to be made to allow for controlled surface adhesion and long-term retention on three dimensional objects. That led them to design their own tiny robot that could overcome problems encountered with other designs. The result of their efforts was a tiny robot, just a few millimeters long, with tiny feet that stick to the mucus covering internal organs without leaving damage behind as the robot walks. The millirobot was also able to climb in any direction, even upside down, and was able to maintain its grip even when liquid was flushed over it.\nThe key to the success of their robot, the researchers claim, is the feet. They first tried footpads that clamped onto tissue but found it difficult to get them to relax their grip. They finally settled on spiked footpads made of chitosan, which they note are similar to plant burrs that attach themselves to pant legs during walks in a field. The body of the robot was made of flexible metal and it was directed using a magnetic current. It makes its way across a mucus covered surface by first planting a foot and attaching and then flipping its body over as it releases another foot. The researchers call it \"peeling and loading.\"\nThe team tested their tiny robot by having it climb around inside a pig lung and digestive tract. As part of the test, they found that they could direct the millirobot down the esophagus and then through bronchial tubes. They also found that they could direct it all the way down the digestive tract.

        "input": "By Joe Gould\nFeb 9, 04:19 AM\nF-35s are built at a Lockheed Martin factory in 2012. The National Defense Industrial Association is raising concerns about the defense-industrial base's health. (Lockheed Martin)\nWASHINGTON ― Lawmakers voiced worries on Wednesday about the health of the defense-industrial base in a House hearing where trade leaders said spending volatility and red tape make it tough for industry to surge capacity.\nAmid broader discussions in the House about potential Pentagon budget cuts, members of the House Armed Services Committee offered a sympathetic forum for the defense sector as important to national security and an economic engine. For their part, leaders with the Aerospace Industries Association, National Defense Industrial Association and Shipbuilders Council of America said industry would respond best to stable demand from government.\n“We cannot prevail in any conflict without a ready, strong and adaptable industrial base. Yet the defense-industrial base is experiencing a multitude of challenges,” said the panel’s chairman, Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Ala. “Some of these include inflation, workforce shortages, bureaucratic hurdles and supply chains that remain too dependent on foreign sources of materials.”\nAmid calls from industry for the administration to adjust otherwise firm-fixed-price contracts to account for inflation, Rogers said the administration “refuses to use the authorities and resources Congress gave them last year to provide necessary relief.”\nIndustry representatives at the hearing said the lack of adjustments hurts companies by depressing wages as the sector grapples with worker shortfalls.\nThe hearing was the second for the committee under the new Republican-led House. It comes amid concerns that Ukraine’s consumption of U.S.-supplied materiel is outstripping the capacity of American defense firms to quickly replenish it ― a negative sign as the U.S seeks to deter China.\nAsked about a Center for Strategic and International Studies report last month that found the U.S. defense-industrial base is unprepared for a notional battle with China over Taiwan, Aerospace Industries Association President and CEO Eric Fanning said wavering demand stymies efforts to stockpile munitions or surge.\n“To have that capability to surge requires a consistent, long-term [government funding] commitment,” Fanning said, adding that some suppliers have become skittish about multiyear contracts, given the specter of inflation eating into profits.\nDespite growing U.S. defense spending and demand for arms fueled by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the defense industry has signaled it won’t expand capacity without a firmer commitment from the government. The trade group chiefs lamented what they saw as overregulation, inconsistent defense spending and bureaucratic barriers for small business. They said uncertainty about Congress raising the debt limit adds a tricky variable.\n“Unfortunately, over the last several years industry has also experienced an unpredictable budget and volatile acquisition environment with repeated shifts in fleet-size [plans] that make [industry’s] CAPEX, or facility, decisions more difficult,” said Matthew Paxton, president of the Shipbuilders Council of America. “The most effective mechanism to ensure the industrial base is stable and resilient is through consistent demand and adequate funding.”\nThe panel’s top Democrat, Rep. Adam Smith, argued that, given industry’s reluctance to increase its manufacturing capacity without a sustained commitment from the government, the U.S. will have to target investments to where it needs arms quickly and in large quantities.\n“We need to figure out what do we really need in the industrial base. You’re not going to be able to prepare for every conceivable contingency; we just don’t have the resources, and the private sector will not make that investment on a wish and a promise,” said Smith of Washington. “We need to be really strategic about it.”\nBoth Rogers and Smith voiced concern with the U.S. defense-industrial base’s reliance on China for critical minerals and semiconductors. Smith suggested that deeper industrial ties with allied nations and opportunities for smaller, innovative defense firms offer potential fixes.\nFanning echoed those concerns and suggested the government provide seed funding to take back a share of critical mineral processing, which China dominates. “It’s an issue for the federal government to help create that market, which is not easy to do,” he said.\nOn Tuesday, the National Defense Industrial Association released its annual report on the state of the U.S. defense-industrial base, which said indicators for industrial base readiness are trending in the wrong direction: The size of America’s defense workforce shrunk to 1.1 million from 3 million in 1985; in five years more than 17,000 companies stopped working in the defense sector; and defense spending as a share of the economy fell 45%.\nAt the hearing, the association’s president and CEO, David Norquist, said among the hindrances are fixed-price contracts that lock in labor rates and growing lags in the government’s security clearance process for private-sector workers.\nHe also suggested using immigration policies to grow the country’s pool of science and technology experts.\nLast week, the head of Naval Sea Systems Command said its “No. 1 strategic challenge” is hiring and retaining skilled workers, as the Navy and its suppliers have thousands of open jobs at government repair yards and in the private shipbuilding and ship repair sectors.\nRep. Joe Courtney of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee, noted that the Pentagon’s budget plan calls for $1.6 billion in long-term investment in the Columbia-class nuclear submarine’s workforce, supply chain and facilities.\nThis prompted Paxton to say that sort of demand signal does get “bang for the buck.”\nAbout Joe Gould\nJoe Gould is the senior Pentagon reporter for Defense News, covering the intersection of national security policy, politics and the defense industry. He served previously as Congress reporter.\n",

        "input": "By exploiting a curious effect called negative capacitance, researchers have designed a transistor that requires a gate voltage about 30% lower than conventional designs. Led by Sayeef Salahuddin at the University of California, Berkeley, the team based their design around an ultrathin superlattice heterostructure, containing alternating layers of ferroelectric and antiferroelectric materials. The team says that its superlattice could be easily integrated into existing transistor designs, reducing their energy requirements.\nAs modern computers grow ever more powerful, the energy they consume is also growing with seemingly no end in sight. Slowing this trend will require fundamental changes to traditional transistor designs.\nMetal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) are ubiquitous in computers and other electronics. They comprise a silicon semiconductor channel through which current can flow between two electrodes. The current flows past a third electrode called the gate, which is separated from the semiconductor channel by an insulating oxide layer. The gate electrode acts like one plate of a capacitor and by varying the voltage applied to the gate, the electronic properties of the silicon can be adjusted. The result is that the current flowing through the channel can be switched on and off.\nOpposite effect\nIn their study, Salahuddin’s team sought to improve this design by exploiting negative capacitance. This an effect that Salahuddin first predicted in 2008 and demonstrated experimentally in 2011. It occurs when a decrease in the voltage across a capacitor results in an increase in the charge stored in the device – the opposite of what happens in conventional capacitors.\nNegative capacitance arises in ferroelectric materials, whose spontaneous electric polarization can be reoriented with the application of an external electric field. To create negative capacitance, an insulating dielectric material is paired with a ferroelectric material – significantly amplifying the amount of charge that accumulates in a ferroelectric material at a given voltage.\nSalahuddin and colleagues have now demonstrated the effect in a new, ultra-thin superlattice material. It comprises alternating, atom-thick layers of the strongly dielectric, ferroelectric material, hafnium dioxide and the antiferroelectric compound zirconium dioxide – which displays zero spontaneous polarization.\nPerformance matching\nTo test their material’s capabilities, the researchers deposited a film of the superlattice just 2 nm thick onto a thin glass layer – separating from it from a silicon layer. In the resulting MOSFET, the team found that the gate voltage could be reduced by about 30%, which reduces the energy consumption of the device. The resulting device was able to match the performance of existing transistor designs.\nSince hafnium dioxide is already widely used in combination with silicon dioxide to form the insulating layers in MOSFETs, this design is highly compatible with existing manufacturing processes. As a result, Salahuddin and colleagues hope that their material could substantially reduce the amount of energy consumed by modern computers, without sacrificing their speed, performance, or small size.\nThe research is described in Nature.\n",

The laser, DE M-SHORAD, is designed to shoot down enemy drones and artillery shells.\nIf the laser is successful, it could enter service as early as 2022.\nThe U.S. Army is finally putting a laser weapon on the ground.\nThe Directed Energy Maneuver Short-Range Air Defense (DE M-SHORAD) system is designed to shoot down not only drones, but also incoming artillery, which has been a vexing problem on the battlefield for hundreds of years. The Army is set to field the first four lasers, mounted to armored vehicles, sometime next year.\nOver the summer, the Army tested DE M-SHORAD at Fort Bliss, home of the service's air defense artillery branch in Texas. The system uses a 50-kilowatt laser weapon system to concentrate a beam of focused laser light at a drone, heating the surface of its skin. In turn, this can cause aerodynamic failure, blind the drone's sensors, disable the engine, or even detonate the fuel supply or explosive payload.\nThis is useful, considering drone attacks are one of the most urgent issues that the Army is currently facing. Small, fast, and capable of carrying a lethal payload, the drone threat has quickly escalated from jury-rigged hobbyist drones to military-grade weapons capable of autonomously engaging enemy troops.\nAlthough the U.S. Army is the most dominant ground force in the world, it was not prepared for this threat, and has scrambled to catch up. DE M-SHORAD—the first Army ground laser weapon—is an outgrowth of this effort. The service plans to mount the laser weapons on Stryker infantry armored vehicles sometime in fiscal year 2022.\nAnother major capability of DE M-SHORAD is the ability to shoot down enemy artillery. For more than a century, the only way ground forces could respond to enemy rockets, mortars, and artillery shells was to dig in, move to another position, or attack the artillery directly. DE M-SHORAD, t he Army claims, can now intercept those munitions in mid- flight, preventing them from landing among friendly troops.\nThe Army has four DE M-SHORAD vehicles, but if the system works as planned, it will almost certainly buy dozens more. The service has nothing else like it for engaging enemy drones and artillery, and it has ten combat divisions and several separate brigades and regiments to protect. The service says this summer's testing \"demonstrated the design characteristics and performance criteria established for the program,\" which is a major step toward fielding the system.\n",

        "input": "The Air Force’s B-21 Raider is designed to prevail against robust air defenses, deliver precision weapons on targets deep in enemy territory and return its two-man crew safely home.\nBut a bigger challenge as the program moves forward is whether the program can prevail in the yearly Defense Department battles over funding, keep its costs down and deliver the 100 aircraft the Air Force says it needs to maintain its edge over adversaries.\nAir Force and Northrop Grumman officials at the B-21 roll-out ceremony in Palmdale, California, gave an upbeat assessment of not only the program’s current costs, but how much funding it will require in the future.\nAndrew Hunter, Air Force undersecretary for acquisition, technology and logistics, told reporters that so far, the program is “tracking well” on cost and schedule.\n“One of the key aspects of this program is that we had a very firm cost target. That is a requirement for the program. And that will support our ability to deliver the number of aircraft we need to truly perform the missions that are outlined in the National Defense Strategy,” he said.\nThe program kicked off 12 years ago with a requirement for 100 aircraft at a cost of $550 million each in 2010 dollars. Officials say the current per-aircraft cost is classified, but with a cumulative rate of inflation of 36.7 percent, that comes to $751 million per aircraft in 2022 dollars.\nMaintaining steady numbers is critical to the Air Force as it divvies up funding for its own needs and engages in the yearly food fight with the Navy, Army and Marine Corps for finite taxpayer dollars to fund their priorities.\nAnd there will be many budget battles in the coming years that will put pressure on the B-21 program.\nJet fighters have their own advocates within the Air Force, which is trying to build out its F-35A Lightning II, field the F-15EX, maintain its legacy fleets and develop a sixth-generation Next Generation Air Dominance fighter.\nBombers are part of the nuclear triad along with submarines and intercontinental ballistic missiles.\nAll three are being modernized and replaced with completely new systems over the next decade, with the Air Force in charge of the Ground-Based Nuclear Deterrent ICBMs as well as upgrading the nuclear command and control infrastructure that ties the triad together. The Navy is building 12 Columbia-class ballistic missile submarines.\nMeanwhile, the Navy’s ultimate goal is to operate as many as 372 ships, the Army has a big modernization push and the Marines are retooling for 21st century conflicts in the Indo-Pacific.\nIn short, the B-21 Raider will have a lot of competition for Defense Department dollars over the next decade.\nAnd cutting the 100 number is no solution, as retired Air Force Col. Chris “Jekyll” Brunner, senior resident fellow for airpower studies at the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies, succinctly put it in a recent podcast.\nThe B-2 Spirit stealth bomber, which Northrop Grumman also developed and manufactured, shows how the Air Force ended up with a $2 billion apiece aircraft, he said.\nThe service was supposed to acquire 132 B-2s, but out-of-control costs and the end of the Cold War prompted Congress to cut their numbers.\nThat put the program in a death spiral.\nBrunner said cutting aircraft numbers is counter-intuitive. “It increases the cost of the aircraft because you don’t have a large enough fleet to spread costs over, so it makes it incredibly hard to modernize and sustain, driving up bills. And that’s how you get a $2 billion airplane,” he said.\nThat’s the predicament the F-35A jet fighter program finds itself in today as the Air Force wants to acquire about 72 A-models per year, but falls short, he noted.\n“You’re going to drive up sustainment costs over the long run because you’re not buying the fleet size that you intended,” he said.\n“My greatest fear with the B-21 is we end up in a B-2 scenario,” he said.\nThe Air Force had to settle for 21 B-2s — and after one of them crashed — now 20. They are being modernized, returning to the factory to be refurbished and updated every nine years.\nBut what of the Sprit’s eventual fate? If history is any guide, the Air Force will eventually build enough B-21s to the point where it will want to retire the B-2 and probably its predecessors, the B-1 Lancer and B-52 Stratofortress.\nBut Congress won’t allow it — finding some way to rationalize their existence — sticking the Air Force with ever-higher bills to sustain aging aircraft in the name of keeping jobs in their districts.\n",
